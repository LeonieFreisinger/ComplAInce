1. Gifts and Hospitality

Gifts and Hospitality includes all business-related benefits such as gifts, meals, entertainment, payment of travel and lodging expenses, trade fair tickets or other contributions without consideration. Under certain circumstances, providing or accepting Gifts and Hospitality could create the appearance of impropriety or even be considered as corruption. To minimize risks for [employees](https://webbooks.siemens.com/public/LC/chen/index.htm?n=General-Introduction,2.-Definitions-and-Abbreviations) and company related to benefits, every employee must comply with the following [general principles](Guidanceongeneral) and requirements when offering or accepting benefits:

[General principles](Guidanceongeneral) – Gifts and Hospitality must

Gifts and Hospitality must not be offered, provided, demanded, or accepted with the expectation of any type of advantage.

Employees must not provide or accept a gift or other benefit before checking it against our general principles. Already a promise or demand of Gifts and Hospitality with the expectation of an advantage (e.g. preferential treatment in competition with other companies) can be illegal.

Gifts and Hospitality must never give the appearance of dishonesty or inappropriateness.

Employees must refrain from any actions that could create an appearance of bad faith or inappropriateness, even if such actions are not illegal.

Gifts and Hospitality must be in accordance with applicable laws and regulations and mindful of internal rules that the recipient, especially government officials, might have.

The local rules of the country in which the benefit is provided is the starting point for evaluating compliance with applicable laws. If the recipient of the benefit does not live in this country, employees shall double-check the rules for the home country of the recipient as to whether any specific local rules apply, such as the prohibition of certain benefits or limits on the value of benefits. Most national laws require their nationals to adhere to the anti-corruption rules of their home country also when being abroad. National laws can vary considerably as to the prohibition of Gifts and Hospitality. In some countries, it may even be obligatory to comply with the internal rules of recipient`s organization, especially in the public sector (Government Officials and their Related Parties). Providing inappropriate gifts or hospitality to [Government Officials](https://webbooks.siemens.com/public/LC/chen/index.htm?n=General-Introduction,2.-Definitions-and-Abbreviations) and their [Related Parties](https://webbooks.siemens.com/public/LC/chen/index.htm?n=General-Introduction,2.-Definitions-and-Abbreviations) is prohibited and punishable by law.

- Information to / Authorization by the Superior of the Beneficiary

Local law or the internal rules, especially in the public sector, might also require that the superior of the beneficiary or a competent entity be informed or their authorization is needed. Depending on the circumstances and local standards, Siemens employees offering benefits should use appropriate, customized wording in their communication with the beneficiary, such as:

- There might be special local regulations applicable to you in respect of the acceptance of these benefits. If you are unsure whether such regulations apply to you, please contact your local legal or compliance department or your superior and check if you are able to accept this offer.
- Please do not forget to inform your superior and to obtain any authorization which might be required according to local laws and your organization&39;s internal rules before accepting this offer.
- When accepting this invitation, we assume that your participation in this event is in compliance with local laws and internal rules applicable to you and that you have informed your superior, if so required.
- When accepting this gift, we assume that the acceptance of this gift is in compliance with local laws and internal rules applicable to you and that you have received the authorization of the competent entity in your organization, if so required.
- This offer of … is conditional upon your compliance with all legal and other requirements for acceptance, including but not limited to anti-corruption laws. By accepting this offer of …. you confirm that you have complied with all legal and other requirements applicable to you, in particular, but not limited to any approval requirement of any competent authority, entity or person.
- This invitation is conditional upon the authorization by the competent entity in your organization.
- When confirming your participation, we would like to ask you to affirm that you have received the authorization of your superior or any other competent entity in your organization for accepting this benefit.
- Due to Public Sector regulations, we must ask you to provide us with a copy of the authorization of your superior for accepting this benefit.

Employees might also use an invitation and registration tool, if available, and insert appropriate compliance disclaimers. In the tool, the registration requirements can differentiate between private and public sector invitees by having the invitees certify that they belong to either sector, subsequently customizing the compliance disclaimer accordingly. For example, public sector invitees can be asked to certify actively that they have informed or received the authorization of their superior, whereas private sector invitees might just be hinted to the fact that Siemens assumes that the beneficiary complies with local laws and internal rules and has informed his superior.

If appropriate, the employee might disclose the value of the [benefit](1.2.Typesof) in the invitation or offering. In addition, the employee might offer the beneficiary that he/she may choose to cover part of the costs, e.g. for accommodation and/or travelling to reduce the benefit to an amount which can be accepted by the beneficiary.

Gifts and Hospitality must be appropriate in terms of type, value, and frequency to the occasion and the position of the recipient.

The appropriateness of a benefit is judged based on all circumstances of the specific occasion, and in accordance with local law and standards. This encompasses the value of the benefit and the occasion on which it is offered, its frequency, the transparency with which it is processed and the position of the beneficiary, in particular whether the recipient will be responsible for making a business decision of significance to Siemens in the near future or has taken such decision in the recent past. The internal rules of the recipient&39;s organization may also provide assurance as to what is considered appropriate under local standards.

Gifts and Hospitality must be provided or received in a transparent manner and correctly recorded in the financial books and records.

Employees shall confer the benefit in such a way that it is obvious to the recipient&39;s employer, line manager or colleagues, and that its nature and value can be verified. Conferring a benefit in secret creates the suspicion of an improper motive on the part of the giver. Employees shall therefore send gifts and invitations to the business address rather than the private address of the recipient, and shall use the company letterhead for the covering letter.
