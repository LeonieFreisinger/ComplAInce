Please note: In case of benefits offered or granted jointly with third parties, the overall situation including the benefits offered or granted/financed by the third parties shall be assessed.

1.2. Types of Benefits
Benefits are any economic and non-economic advantages which improve the recipients/beneficiaries position. Economic benefits are money or tangible non-monetary benefits such as [Gifts and Meals (A.1.2.1.),](1.2.1.Giftsand)[Entertainment Events (A.1.2.2.)](1.2.2.EntertainmentEvents*) or [Travel and Lodging (A.1.2.3.)](1.2.3.Traveland)as well as [Other Contributions without Consideration (A.1.2.4.).](1.2.4.OtherContributions) Non-economic benefits are any other advantages. They may include, for example, a job or an internship for the recipient or the recipients
[Related Parties](https://webbooks.siemens.com/public/LC/chen/index.htm?n=General-Introduction,2.-Definitions-and-Abbreviations), the granting of a permit or an introduction to certain influential people [(A.1.2.5.).](1.2.5.Dealingwith)

1.2.1. Gifts and Meals
A Gift is a present or something that is given to an individual without payment. Meals include food and drinks.

Meals as Entertainment Events

If Meals are combined with additional benefits, they might be considered an [Entertainment Event](1.2.2.EntertainmentEvents*). In such case the Meal and any additional benefits must be handled in their entirety as an Entertainment Event.

Gifts of Money

Gifts of money encompass any benefit of a nature comparable to a monetary gift, for example, checks, shares, bonds or credit notes for a monetary amount, as well as vouchers for goods that can be redeemed in cash. Vouchers for goods that cannot be redeemed in cash, or fuel vouchers for a specific quantity of a specific type of gasoline are not considered monetary gifts.

Gifts of money generally create the appearance of bad faith or impropriety. Therefore, such gifts require the prior written approval of the responsible Compliance Officer even where they are permitted under local law.

Specific Principles

Besides the [general principles](1.1Guidanceon) and possibly [country or industry specific requirements](1.5.SpecificRequirements*)Siemens does not make gifts in illegally traded wildlife products, e.g. rhino horn, ivory and tiger, and does not accept such gifts from third parties.

SpoDoM-Approval

Providing Meals or Gifts to third parties does not require prior SpoDoM-Approval.

1.2.2. Entertainment Events

An Entertainment Event comprises any event where the price is not only paid for food and drinks but includes, for example, an (implicit) supplement
 for music or other entertainment. This encompasses folk festivals.

Specific Principles

Besides the [general principles](1.1Guidanceon) and possibly [country or industry specific requirements](1.5.SpecificRequirements*), Entertainment Events shall comply with the following standards:

- Wherever possible, the Entertainment Event shall be part of a business program ;
- Review and approval by the manager responsible according to applicable signature regulations must be documented. The manager shall review whether the intended activity is in line with Siemens rules as set out in these instructions;
- Tickets must be acquired via official sales offers , not on the black market.

SpoDoM-Approval

Regarding a SpoDoM-Approval for providing Entertainment Events to Government Officials and their Related Parties, Healthcare Providers, members of a purchasing department or beneficiaries that are involved in important business decisions (Risk Groups) see [Chapter A 1.3](1.3.Processand).

1.2.3. Travel and Lodging Costs

Travel and Lodging Costs for third parties are e.g. costs for inspection tours, acceptance visits, training.

Exceptions

The reimbursement of travel costs for job applicants is not considered a benefit for the purposes of these instructions. The same applies for occasionally and spontaneously driving employees of customers or other third parties or giving these persons a lift in ones own taxi. However, this exemption does not apply for arrangements to drive someone repeatedly.

The reimbursement of travel and lodging costs incurred by a service provider that are necessarily implied in providing a service ordered by and performed for Siemens does not constitute a benefit in the sense of these instructions. Costs shall however only be reimbursed if reimbursement has been agreed in advance, for example by means of a contract or a purchase order.

The same applies for conference speakers who have been invited to present a subject on behalf of Siemens on a conference or a congress. The reimbursement of these implied travel and lodging costs does not constitute a benefit in the sense of these instructions. However, specific regulations and reporting requirements may apply if the invited person works in the [public sector](PublicSector) or is a [Healthcare Provider](1.4.2.Specificrequirements). In such cases, [the applicable local and industry specific regulations](1.5.SpecificRequirements*) must be checked or the responsible Compliance Officer shall be contacted.

Specific Principles

Besides the [general principles](Guidanceongeneral) and possibly [country or industry specific requirements](1.5.SpecificRequirements*), reimbursing Travel and Lodging Costs for third parties shall comply with the following standards:

- The reimbursement itself (instead of a payment by the third party itself), the number and function of the persons (e.g. few or many, with or without spouses) as well as the standard of the travel (e.g. economy or business class) and lodging (e.g. three or four star hotel) and their duration must be justified by a legitimate business purpose.
- The costs need to be proportional compared to what is received in return (the standard of travel and lodging, the travelling duration, as well as number of travelling persons).
- Cost reimbursements may not be  made to private bank accounts or to individual persons or to third parties (other than the employer of the beneficiary) for forwarding to the beneficiaries.
- Because travel agencies can be used to create slush funds, employees shall avoid reimbursement of costs for travelling or entertainment arranged by travel agencies for employees of the customer or other third party if Siemens has no sufficient control over the arrangements and their execution. In case the use of a travel agency is necessary, employees shall select agencies with high integrity and insist on an itemized, detailed proof of service and receipts of accommodation and travel providers.

Local vs. Non-Local Travel Cost

As local travel costs do not require a SpoDoM-Approval, it is important to distinguish between local and non-local travel costs.

Crossing a country border does not per se imply that the travel must be considered non-local. In case the nearest transportation stop to or from a Siemens facility is nearby but in another country, the travel may still be considered local provided it otherwise fits into the criteria for local travel. An approval in the SpoDoM tool thus is not required if the employee of the customer or supplier must be brought to the nearest transportation stop (e.g. a taxi to the airport or train station) which happens to be abroad due to the location of the Siemens facility.

Siemens regional companies may further define what falls under local travel for their respective country (for example with reference to a specific monetary threshold or a threshold regarding distance, means of transportation or otherwise). If there are various Siemens companies in the same country, the country specific definition shall be aligned among them. Country specific definitions of what is considered local travel shall be notified to the contact persons for gifts and hospitality at LC CO PT and LC CO RFC LF and shall be made available via the Compliance intranet.

SpoDoM-Approval

Regarding a SpoDoM-Approval for providing lodging or non-local travel to Government Officials and their Related Parties, Healthcare Providers, members of a purchasing department or beneficiaries that are involved in important business decisions (Risk Groups) see [Chapter A 1.3.](1.3.Processand)1.

2.3.1. Daily Allowances

Daily Allowances are intended for reimbursement of daily travel and lodging costs.

Specific Principles

Besides the [general principles](Guidanceongeneral) and the [specific principles for travel and lodging costs](TravelCostSpecificPrinciples), Daily Allowances for third parties shall comply with the following standards:

- The occasion and the amount shall, where possible, be specified in the customer contract or tender documents. If a Daily Allowance is requested but not yet specified, occasion and amount shall be made transparent to the customer and aligned with an authorized representative of the customer and the supervisor of the beneficiary. Try to amend the contract. Have the customer guarantee if possible in the contract that the requested Daily Allowances are in line with local law;
- In case the customer did not determine the amount of the Daily Allowance, use the travel reimbursement guidelines of the customer for the country the Daily Allowance is granted as a guideline for what is adequate. Should the customer not have such a guideline, use Siemens travel guidelines for the country the Daily Allowance is granted;
- In case an authorized representative of the customer requests Siemens to transfer the Daily Allowance to his employees directly for legitimate reasons (e.g. money transfer or currency restrictions) indicating the account number(s), Daily Allowances may be paid to individual accounts, unless such transfer infringes applicable law or Siemens rules. The beneficiary must acknowledge the receipt. Customers request and beneficiarys receipt must be documented. In all communications accompanying a payment or reimbursement, it must be clearly stated that it is being made to a recipient organization and not for the benefit of an individual person;
- If payment of Daily Allowances to a third party for forwarding to the beneficiaries is absolutely necessary for legitimate reasons (e.g. money transfer or currency restrictions), confirm this with the customer and have the customer certify that this is in line with local law. Customer confirmation and receipt of the Daily Allowance by the beneficiaries shall be documented;
- The beneficiary shall be reminded that the Daily Allowance might have to be declared under local tax laws and that Siemens does not take over the tax. The customer or the beneficiary must evaluate and implement any such requirement;
- There are additional prerequisites for handing out cash as set forth in [Siemens Circular No. 208](https://circulars.siemens.com/content/circulars/ca/layouts/querplex/circularapplication/documents/CircularDownload.aspx?id=sc208.pdf). Avoid handing out cash, see also Chapter C.
