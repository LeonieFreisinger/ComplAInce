# 5. Compliance@Production Facilities

Compliance is also relevant in the manufacturing area. Therefore, it is important to identify and to know how to handle possible Compliance topics in that part of the business.

| **Identified fields of Compliance related challenges are:**

- **Handling of Company property**


- **Theft** of equipment constitutes damage to the company`s property and must be reported (see **[„IncidentReporting@Siemens&quot; (IR@S)](https://compliance.siemens.cloud/bcg/procedures.html)**[or](https://compliance.siemens.cloud/bcg/procedures.html) **GM SEC Abteilung** )

- **Scrap** and leftover material from the production must be handled in a proper way (see [One pager](https://findit.compliance.siemens.com/content/10000101/Compliance/LC_CO/LC_CO_STR/findIT_LC_CO_STR_5132.pdf))


- **Handling of Company information** requires considerable vigilance


- **Your signature your responsibility** means that those who have authority to sign should always check very carefully what they are about to approve when they are asked to sign(see [Integrity Moments 201](javascript:Download(&#39;https://findit.compliance.siemens.com/content/10000101/Compliance/CL_CO/CL_CO_AT/findIT_CL_CO_AT_6495.pptx&#39;))8)


- **Conflict of interest** [(see Chapter A.4.)](https://webbooks.siemens.com/public/LC/chen/index.htm?n=Part-1-Activity-Fields,A.-Anti-Corruption,4.-Conflict-of-interest)


- **Reporting of wrongdoing** (see [Business Conduct Guidelines, Chapter &quot;Our reporting procedures&quot;) **.**](https://compliance.siemens.cloud/bcg/procedures.html)


- **Child labor** is strictly **prohibited** at production facilities ([see Chapter E.6.6.1.1.)](https://webbooks.siemens.com/public/LC/chen/index.htm?n=Part-1-Activity-Fields,E.-Human-Rights,6.-Toolbox,6.6.-Risk-factors/areas,6.6.1.-Labor-Issues-and-OHS,6.6.1.1.-Child-labor).

A **scribble video** explaining SIEMENS Compliance at production facilities can be found [here](https://myvideo.siemens.com/media/SIEMENS+Compliance+Factory+EN+Subtitle/1_pdob8fjt) (available also in Dutch). It explains in a smart and easy to understand way how Compliance also has an effect within production facilities. The Video uses a potential theft as an example to explain:

- Compliance in general
- tasks of the compliance organization
- actions in case of theft
- reporting channels
- whistleblowing
- Compliance and ownership culture.

A **special WBT** for colleagues in production facilities will be available soon.
