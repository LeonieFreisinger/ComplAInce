# 0. Introduction to Business Processes and Projects

Siemens business is often closely connected to processes which support procurement, sale of products or to projects which handle the major undertakings.

Both business types show characteristic challenges and risk areas. Siemens manages these factors via the creation of a respective awareness and, if adequate, further trainings and support tools.

This chapter takes the perspective of the business and intends to provide access to the different risks and activity fields (chapters A. â€“ G.) by explaining them in the context of Compliance in Business Processes.

The different fields considered are:
