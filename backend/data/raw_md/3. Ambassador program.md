# 3. Ambassador Program

This guidance addresses the Compliance Officers in Regions, OpCos and Corporate units. The implementation of the Compliance Ambassador approach is on a voluntary basis. Compliance Officers may decide whether to introduce the concept in their entity by themselves.

The target of this Compliance Ambassador Guidance is to summarize, standardize and develop all the best practices in one common setup.

Globally we will only use the term „Compliance Ambassador&quot; (CoA).

**Objectives of the Compliance Ambassador approach**

The Compliance Ambassador performs a voluntary support function as „local first line contact&quot; between Compliance Officers as trusted business partners and local employees to facilitate a successful and sustainable business.

The Compliance Ambassador is a local point of contact for employees and the Compliance Officer. He or she answers employee&#39;s basic compliance questions (e.g. how to find information on the Compliance Intranet), supports compliance communication initiatives, and highlights potential risks or areas where Compliance training might be needed. He or she involves the Compliance Officers as necessary.

Compliance Ambassadors should be role models for Siemens values and integrity in daily business and make an important contribution to our Compliance System.

# 3.1 Set-up, selection and appointment

It is recommended that a Compliance Officer, who wants to introduce the Compliance Ambassador approach, takes into account the necessity, number of locations and resources etc. in close cooperation with the responsible management/business of the respective entity.

In the process of introducing the Compliance Ambassador approach, especially the selection of appropriate colleagues, it is recommended that a Compliance Officer consults the relevant management of the entity and employee´s manager (manager of the potential candidate).

Adequate platform for obtaining management´s approval for the implementation could be a Compliance Review Board meeting (CRB), if in place in the relevant entity. The selection of candidates could be agreed thereafter with the above mentioned parties bilaterally or in case of small entities as well within the CRB or another management team meeting.

### 3.1.1. Assignment

The Compliance Ambassador is not assigned to the Compliance Organization, but represents the link between his or her organizational unit and Compliance Officer, on a voluntary basis. The Compliance Ambassador takes on additional part-time responsibilities above his or her daily tasks and responsibilities that can be added to personal PMP targets, but at sole decision by the employee´s manager and the Compliance Ambassador. Headcount and related costs will not be charged to the Compliance Organization.

Before starting, the Compliance Ambassador shall receive an official appointment letter upon nomination, and after terminating he or she shall receive a release letter. Appointment and release letters shall mandatorily be co-signed by the relevant Compliance Officer and the employee´s manager (or other management representative according to the signature regulations in the entity, e.g. CEO in smaller or Functional Head in larger entities). Compliance Ambassador shall also sign the appointment letter to confirm his or her consent to the appointment to his or her new role.

It shall be mutually agreed by the above mentioned persons, for which period of time the Compliance Ambassador shall be appointed, whereby all parties should have the possibility of termination with an immediate effect.

A possible template of the appointment letter as well as a release letter is available on the Compliance Ambassador workspace (see point 5 of this guidance).
