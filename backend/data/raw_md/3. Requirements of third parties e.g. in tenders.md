## 3. Requirements of third parties e.g. in tenders

Siemens may encounter compliance requirements of third parties in different constellations. Most commonly in business processes customers or suppliers might want to clarify if Siemens is a reliable company. This could happen in individual tenders or supplier qualification processes. The responsible Compliance Officer needs to be involved before:

- Signing off a Customer`s Codes of Conduct or related contract clauses in individual cases ([H 3.1.](https://webbooks.siemens.com/public/LC/chen/index.htm?n=Part-2-Business-Perspective,H.-Compliance-in-Business-Processes-and-Projects,3.-Requirements-of-third-parties-e.g.-in-tenders,3.1-Customer-Codes-of-Conduct---related-Contract-Clauses))
- Answering to compliance questionnaires or making compliance declarations on an customer`s template ([H 3.2.](#_3.2_Compliance_Questionnaires))

On the other hand, Siemens might receive requests for information or cooperation from authorities which need to be handled by LC CO RFC LF. Please note that the Clearing Committee ([L 7.3.](https://workspace.c6.siemens.com/content/300000007/Compliance%20WebBook/Part%202%20Business%20Perspective/H)%20Compliance%20in%20Business%20Processes%20and%20Projects/_layouts/15/hypernet/custom/link.aspx?bid=00010023&amp;pt=7._x0020Dealing_x0020with_x0020public_x0020authorities_x0020and_x0020other_x0020third_x0020parties&amp;tt=7.3._x0020Clearing_x0020Committee)) needs to decide about providing other than standardized information in certain cases.

 | Please be aware that the **legal entity Siemens AG** is subject to two
 Antitrust-related decisions in Belgium and Greece. Both cases require the Reliability Declaration for the **legal entity Siemens AG**
 ([EN](https://lkb.siemens.com/content/00000008/LegalKnowledgeBase/y5t2v029dbqp/LKB001677.docx)/[DE](https://lkb.siemens.com/content/00000008/LegalKnowledgeBase/y5t2v029dbqp/LKB001676.docx)) to be handed over to prospective customers of the legal entity
 Siemens AG. The Greek case also leads to the necessity for the **legal entity Siemens AG**
 to admit to an infringement of Antitrust provisions in a **Single European
 Procurement Document (ESPD)** or similar declarations. The ESPD Compliance
 Guidelines for Siemens AG (available [here](https://intranet.for.siemens.com/org/lc/en/legal/templates/public/public/Pages/public.aspx)) provides information on filling out the
 questions of the ESPD related to Compliance cases for the legal entity Siemens AG. |

Please keep in mind that besides the requirement above, this chapter not binding. It merely contains suggestions how to handle the challenges of the covered constellations.

### 3.1 Customer Codes of Conduct &amp; related Contract Clauses

Companies are increasingly publishing their conduct/ethical standards. There might be a requirement to accept the contractual partner&#39;s code of conduct or required clauses in a contract. When agreeing to a customer code or contract requirements, these will form part of the legal relationship between the parties. Failure to adhere to the requirements may result in contractual breaches and consequences with respect to such breaches. Careful consideration must be given to assess whether the requirements can actually be met. Obligations can only be agreed upon if Siemens may actually and reasonably comply with them. Different sustainability topics besides Compliance like HR or EHS need to be checked by those departments
# 1
.

| **What to do in an individual business relationship:**
1. **check if customer**

- has an **equivalent CoC** [accepted by SCM](https://intranet.for.siemens.com/cms/050/en/about/initiatives/Documents/Procurement_Standards/CoC/Equivalent_Supplier_Codes.pdf) which can be accepted for your contract;
- has **agreed to Siemens CoC** as a Siemens **Supplier** (Corporate Master Database (LINK)) or **Business Partner** ([Due Diligence Tool](https://compliance-tools.siemens.com/due-diligence/));
- has agreed that **Siemens` standards are sufficient** or concluded an **agreement with Siemens on ethical standards** ([Sharepoint](https://l-collaboration.siemens.com/workspaces/mra/default.aspx));
 and make use of the fact for your contract.
1. Suggest to customer that **we stick to our high compliance standards** rather than agree to his using this sample letter and clause ([EN](https://findit.compliance.siemens.com/content/10000101/Compliance/LC_CO/LC_CO_RG_PL/findIT_LC_CO_RG_PL_7591.docx)/[DE](https://findit.compliance.siemens.com/content/10000101/Compliance/LC_CO/LC_CO_RG_PL/findIT_LC_CO_RG_PL_7590.docx)). If he agrees, responsible Legal Counsel or Compliance Officer should document the unilateral recognition by the customer in this [Sharepoint](https://l-collaboration.siemens.com/workspaces/mra/default.aspx).
2. **If customer insists on his compliance standards,** check them according to this [guidance](https://findit.compliance.siemens.com/content/10000101/Compliance/LC_CO/LC_CO_RG_PL/findIT_LC_CO_RG_PL_7629.docx):

- **Compliance view** to be assessed by Compliance Officer: Siemens can accept customer compliance standards in the course of this individual contractual solution **if they can be fulfilled and are not more stringent** than Siemens internal Compliance regulations
- **Legal view** to be assessed by Legal Counsel: Siemens can accept customer compliance standards in the course of this individual contractual solution **if the legal consequences for their breach or the customers` legal rights in connection with them are acceptable** (e.g. audit, termination rights or damage claims

1. In case the customers` compliance standards are **more stringent than Siemens`** , a decision has to be made involving the superiors of the responsible Compliance Officer and the Legal Counsel if Siemens can accept them. Mitigation actions must be defined to prevent Siemens from inacceptable risk.
**What to do for a framework solution:** Please see here for [Framework Agreements](https://l-collaboration.siemens.com/workspaces/mra/default.aspx)on ethical standards, e.g. with global partners or for framework agreements on ethical standards relating to a greater number of contracts with the customer. |

### 3.2 Compliance Questionnaires &amp; Declarations

Often, public or private customers or other third parties request Siemens to answer questions or to make declarations regarding its integrity and reliability or relating to compliance cases. Different sustainability topics besides Compliance like HR or EHS need to be checked by those departments
# 2
.

| **What to do:**
1. Suggest to customer / third party to verify with our[publicly available information](https://www.siemens.com/global/en/home/company/sustainability.html)that Siemens fulfills the highest standards by using this sample response ([EN](https://findit.compliance.siemens.com/content/10000101/Compliance/LC_CO/LC_CO_RG_PL/findIT_LC_CO_RG_PL_7589.docx)/[DE](https://findit.compliance.siemens.com/content/10000101/Compliance/LC_CO/LC_CO_RG_PL/findIT_LC_CO_RG_PL_7588.docx)).
2. Identify, if the request refers to a particular **Siemens subsidiary, Siemens AG** or the whole **Siemens Group** and try to answer using the information below.
3. Contact the **responsible Compliance Officer** and/or other **contact person indicated below** in case of questions.

In case of a request of a sustainability or comparable rating agency please always align with LC CO RFC LF for Compliance aspects.
