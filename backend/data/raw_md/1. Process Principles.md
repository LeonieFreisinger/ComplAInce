# 3. Questions &amp; Answers

- **What is the difference between a Compliance Investigation and an audit?**

Investigation is the process of inquiring into a matter of possible individual misconduct through research, follow-up, study, or formal procedure of discovery, in order to establish the facts of this matter. Investigating means to examine a misconduct, crime, problem, statement, etc. in an objective and independent manner with either exculpatory or incriminatory results.

It helps an organization accomplish its objectives by offering a systematic, disciplined approach to evaluate and improve the effectiveness of risk management, control, and governance processes.
