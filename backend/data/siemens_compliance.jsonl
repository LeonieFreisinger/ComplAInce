{"text": "Data privacy laws are being introduced for the first time or else are being tightened up, not only in the EU in the form of the directly applicable General Data Protection Regulation adopted on April 14, 2016, but also in many other countries. At the same time, supervisory authorities are being put in place and given more rights than ever. This is accompanied by greater media coverage and an increase in the number of public tenders which request data privacy solutions. This change has a tangible impact for Siemens AG and Siemens Affiliated Companies located within or outside the EU and requires adapting Siemens' data privacy related processes to the applicable legal framework. Data Privacy in a nutshell - Personal data means any information that relates to an identified or identifiable natural person. - Processing of personal data requires a legitimate legal basis. Examples of legal bases include contractual relationships, legitimate interests of the company or consent by the data subject. - Any employee who becomes aware of a data breach must take immediate action and inform the Data Privacy Organization as described in the Data Privacy Incident Management Process. - Applicable data privacy laws often require companies to maintain a detailed record of all processing activities of personal information. Any processing of personal information in an application or system must be documented within the Siemens CDP Center by the respective process owner with the support of IT. - Data Privacy laws require appropriate data processing agreements that contain requirements for service providers which provide data processing services (such as hosting or similar solutions). More Information on our Data Privacy Management System are available here. The first key principle - Data privacy compliance as the responsibility of each Siemens employee Complying with the law is a fundamental principle for Siemens. All Siemens employees are required to perform their daily tasks in accordance with applicable laws and regulations, including laws and regulations on data privacy (for example sections H7 of the Business Conduct Guidelines). This chapter therefore provides support to help employees from the respective target groups to comply with this principle in their daily work. Further directives are included in the Binding Corporate Rules (BCR) for the Protection of Personal Data. The second key principle - Collaboration between the stakeholders identified and the Data Privacy Organization Data privacy compliance falls under the responsibility of the Controller and the Processor . Collaboration between Siemens entities is a key driver in Siemens' compliance with applicable laws and regulations. In addition, the Siemens Data Privacy Organization supports stakeholders in the implementation of their respective tasks defined herein and acts as an intermediary between the stakeholders and external parties (e.g. supervisory authorities, data subjects, service providers and third parties). An overview of the Siemens Data Privacy Organization including data privacy contacts in Siemens entities can be found in the Intranet. Any breach of security leading to the accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorized disclosure of, or access to personal data may trigger notification requirements to authorities and data subjects. For this purpose, any employee who becomes aware of such a breach must take immediate action in line with the Data Privacy Incident Management Guidance and inform the Data Privacy Organization, if possible by using the data breach report form. Any communication with supervisory authorities and data subjects concerned needs to be coordinated with the Data Privacy Organization. Applicable data privacy laws (such as the EU data protection regulation) often require companies to maintain a detailed record of all processing activities and to conduct a privacy impact assessment for certain processing operations. Such processing activities shall be documented within the Siemens CDP Center by the respective Process Owner with the support of the IT (responsible for describing the technical and organizational measures and the possible engagement of further sub-processors). Documentation in the CDP Center is mandatory if: - the Controller is situated in a country in which an application register is required by law, or - a Siemens entity acts as Processor for a Controller located in a country with this type of documentation requirement. Even in other cases, a notification in the CDP Center is highly recommended in order to obtain a comprehensive overview of data privacy risks within Siemens. EU and other data privacy laws impose contractual requirements for the provision of processing services (such as SaaS, hosting or similar solutions). These requirements apply in particular to Sales, Procurement, LC and IT. Such requirements include the obligation to - carefully select a provider, taking into account the adequacy of the technical and organizational measures implemented and - agree on certain contract terms for the data processing agreement (by including data processing terms with certain mandatory content). Siemens AG or an Affiliated Company is directly bound by the statutory requirement to enter into", "metadata": "D. Data Privacy-1"}
{"text": "such data processing terms even if it only acts as provider (i.e. a Processor) for customers. In regard to external customer / provider facing agreements there are sample data processing terms for Siemens acting as Customer and Siemens acting as Provider available on the intranet. Furthermore there is an existing internal data processing agreement between all Siemens Group Companies(Intercompany Agreement). If the provision of processing services (such as SaaS, hosting or similar solutions) involves personal data and such services are purchased from an external IT service provider, the technical and organizational measures implemented by this service provider must be audited on a regular basis by the respective Process Owner.Additional stakeholders are IT. The intervals of such audits depend on the criticality of the personal data processed in the case of IT applications and services containing sensitive HR data, audits should be conducted every two years. For this purpose, it is recommended that the Process Owner requests applicable and current audit reports and certifications from the service provider and retains a copy thereof for documentation purposes. For low risk applications the audit may be based on self-assessments. Data privacy laws often grant information and access rights to individuals.The stakeholder involved is the Process Owner. Information on processing personal data shall be provided at the time when personal data is obtained (e.g. through a privacy notice in the application). Access rights to personal data processed (including a copy thereof) shall also be considered, depending on the applicable laws. The Siemens HR Privacy Notice describes the processing of personal data of the Siemens employees. In the development of Siemens products, solutions and services the principles of data privacy by design (and by default) shall be taken into account throughout the development process. Concerned stakeholder are Cybersecurity, R&D, Quality managers and CT. The Circular No. 236 Cybersecurity requires that Siemens complies with data privacy laws, e.g. the General Data Protection Regulation, including the privacy by design and by default principle. These principles require Siemens to consider data privacy during the whole lifecycle of a product, solution and service in order to - implement measures and product components which meet the data protection principles within products, solutions and services (Privacy by Design), and - apply privacy friendly settings automatically, without requiring the user to make manual changes to the privacy settings (Privacy by Default).

{"text": "Conflicts of interest can arise in a variety of constellations, when the interests of an individual or of his/her close personal relations diverge from those of the company or organization to which the individual belongs or belonged to. Conflicts of interest can hinder the success of a company, lead to economic damages and also tarnish the company's reputation if they become public, for instance, if the conflict of interest leads to uneconomical decisions, if customers get lost because they lose confidence in the integrity of the company or if confidential information is disclosed as a result. In some cases, conflicts of interest might also bear anti-corruption or antitrust risks. To minimize risks related to conflicts of interest, every employee must comply with the following general principles: General Principles: - Business decisions always have to be made in the best interest of the company and not on the basis of personal interests. - Situations, in which the appearance of a conflict of interest may arise, have to be anticipated and avoided. Avoiding a conflict of interest can also mean to abstain from decisions that could be affected by the conflict of interest. - Situations, in which the appearance of a conflict of interest may arise, have to be disclosed There are typical constellations, in which a conflict of interest may potentially arise. In particular, such a conflict can be caused by: - Direct relationships of Siemens employees or external Business Partners 2 , i.e. Siemens employees or external Business Partners themselves, personally have: - Personal relations (A.5.1.1.). - Secondary/prior/subsequent employment in third party companies (A.5.1.4.), including job rotation between the public and the private sector (A.5.1.5.). - Competitive interest and/or investment in third party companies (A.5.1.2. und A.5.1.3.). - Indirect relationships of Siemens employees or external Business Partners , i.e. friends and/or family of Siemens employees or external Business Partners have: - Personal relations (A.5.1.1.). - Employment in third party companies (A.5.1.4). - Competitive interest and/or investment in third party companies (A.5.1.2. und A.5.1.3.). By its nature, a conflict of interest may potentially arise not only to the detriment of Siemens but also for the benefit of Siemens. In both cases, the same rules apply. In any case, especially if in doubt, please involve Compliance as early as possible. Close relations can lead to a conflict of interest, if business decisions are made on the basis of personal interests as a result. Typical examples: - There is an intimate relationship between an employee and a manager and the manager grants an undue advantage to the employee due to the personal relationship. In this case, the manager is obliged to disclose the conflict of interest at an early stage and to eliminate it by e.g. changing the reporting relationships. - There is a recommendation of a good friend for a job at Siemens or that the Siemens employee concludes a contract with a specific supplier, in whose company a close relative or good friend of the Siemens employee works. Both of the examples and similar situations can be solved by creating transparency. We must adhere to the following: - We have to inform the HR department and follow the regular processes without offering exceptions what so ever. A conflict of interest may also arise in business relationships with or through investments in a competitor or customer of Siemens. See also A.5.1.3. and A.5.1.4. Typical examples: - The employee also works for or advises a competitor of Siemens. - The employee himself competes directly with Siemens (by offering products that Siemens sells). - There are personal or family ties to competitors. We must adhere to the following: - We do not operate or work for a company that competes with Siemens. - We do not engage in any activity that competes with Siemens. Conflicts of interest can also arise in the case of direct or indirect investments in third-party companies or other forms of influence on a company. For Business partners of Siemens that only applies if Siemens is engaged in business with the respective company or has a mandate there. In the case of investments in publicly traded companies, this only applies if the investment exceeds three percent of the total capital. For competitors the above applies if the management of the competitor can be influenced through the investment. This can be assumed if the interest exceeds three percent of the total capital of this company. A conflict of interest may also arise in business relationships with or through investments in a competitor or customer of Siemens. Typical examples: - The employee also works for or advises a competitor of Siemens. - The employee himself offers products that Siemens sells. - There are personal or family ties to competitors. - the offer of a seat on the supervisory board of another organization.", "metadata": "5. Conflict of interest-1"}
{"text": "The third-party company might be a Business Partner or a competitor of Siemens. These activities require Siemens' approval. We must adhere to the following: - We inform the Human Resources department in writing of any direct or indirect investment in companies: - That are business partners of Siemens if We are engaged in business with the company or have a board or management role in the company. With respect to publicly traded companies, this only applies if the investment exceeds three percent of the total capital. - That compete with our company if We can influence the management of the competitor through this investment. This is presumed if the interest exceeds three percent of the total capital of the company. A conflict may arise in the performance of secondary activities or employment, which prevent the employee from properly performing his duties at Siemens. Secondary employment can only be prohibited, and previously granted permission only be revoked, if it leads to an impairment of the employee's work performance, interferes with his or her duties within the company, or if there is a risk of a conflict of interest. Occasional writing, lecturing, and similar activities, and temporary seasonal or clerical work are not regarded as secondary employment. Typical examples: - The employee could have an accident at work due to being overtired and exhausted by his secondary employment. Therefore, such a secondary employment must be approved by Siemens. But: Only occasional writing activities, lectures, and similar occasional activities as well as temporary work are not regarded as secondary employment. - A prior or subsequent employment on the other hand can for example lead to the disclosure of confidential information or business secrets, if the employee does not handle the situation with care. We must adhere to the following: - Before we engage in paid secondary employment, we consult with our managers. - We inform the HR department in writing that we would like to take up paid secondary employment and will only do so after obtaining written consent. A conflict of interest can also arise if employees of a company switch to the public sector or vice versa. The fast or repeated change between the public service (politics/ ministries) and the private sector may in particular lead to conflicts of interest, e.g. to influence on the legislation through the use of insider knowledge and acquired contacts. Waiting periods, i.e. a waiting period between the change of positions, are intended to remedy this situation. In this context, the so-called Karenzzeitengesetz (waiting period act) has been introduced in Germany in 2015, but other countries also have corresponding laws and regulations. For Siemens employees but also for Siemens itself, different risks may arise in connection with the change of public servants to the private sector and vice versa. Thereby it makes no difference whether Siemens employees move to the public sector or vice versa or whether they do so temporarily as part of exchange programs or for an indefinite period of time. We must adhere to the following: - Thorough subject and environment check (previous activity - planned position) especially of former or current contacts to Siemens (e.g. in the context of award procedures) in order to avoid conflicts of interest. - Transparent selection process. - Clear and transparent documentation of the secondment. - Examination and maintenance of legal requirements (e.g. Sec. 105 Federal Civil Servants Act (Bundesbeamtengesetz), laws on waiting periods, etc.) in this respect, if necessary, also obtain a confirmation that the hiring does not conflict with statutory, contractual or other legal obstacles and waiting period regulations from the previous function. The following measures should be taken: - If necessary, implementation of further internal security measures (e.g. circular). - Limitation of secondment time (generally up to six months in justified individual cases prolongation possible). - No assignment to drafting bills, to executive functions or to those with final decision-making authority, to the awarding of public contracts and to functions whose exercise directly affects the specific business interests of the sending office. - For inquiries on lobbying topics, the Siemens communication principles must be observed. Therefore, always involve GM and CM, respectively, and please coordinate potential reactions with GM GA EU and LC C GF. In case of doubt please refer to your Compliance Officer or to Compliance Legal (LC CO RFC LF). Karenzzeitengesetz: - Waiting period for retiring members of the Federal Government as well as for parliament state secretaries to prevent conflicts of interest between the public service contract and employment after office. - Obligation to notify the Federal Government or its responsible member in the event of the intention to take up employment outside the public sector within the first 18 months after leaving office. - Possibility of prohibiting intended employment in case of possible interference with public interests. - Limitation", "metadata": "5.

The administrative authority can then prohibit the new activity. Anyone who disregards this prohibition loses his pension rights, Sec. 105 Federal Civil Servants Act (Bundesbeamtengesetz BBG). - In the extreme case, possibly criminal acceptance of benefits (Sec. 331 German Criminal Code). - Even if the legally required waiting periods are adhered to, Sec. 331 et seq. of the German Criminal Code and the Siemens BCGs are to be observed. Important: An employment may not be offered or granted in return for the performance of the service. Already the appearance of dishonesty is to be avoided. European Union - Members of the European Commission must notify the Commission of any intended professional activity which is to commence within 18 months after leaving the office. - Lobbying in former departments is completely prohibited during this time. - Furthermore, the Commissioners are subject to a non-competition clause: if there could be conflicts of interest with the former area of responsibility, an ethics committee decides on compatibility. - For other employees in EU-Institutions, a similar waiting period of up to three years applies. Czech Republic - The permission to take up a position in the public service must be granted by the employer the employment must not be terminated. However, there is no entitlement to remuneration during the exercise of the public office. - After giving up/ leaving the public office, the employee has the right to continue working in a position of equal rank. The only exception would be the removal of the position in the meantime. If the employee is employed at a lower position, he would have to be fully compensated. - Confidential information obtained during affiliation with the company or the public employer may not be taken into account at the other office. USA - Waiting periods for mandate holders and staff members of the executive range from one year to up to a lifelong ban on certain activities. - For the legislative, a different waiting period of one up to two years applies. To protect ourselves and our company, we pay close attention to possible conflicts of interest. The following questions help us to assess whether this is the case: - Is the decision I make for Siemens influenced by personal interests? - What impression does the situation leave on external third parties, such as customers, authorities, and investors? - How would the public react to my business decision? We must adhere to the following: 1. In case of competition with Siemens (For details please refer to A.5.1.2.): - We do not operate or work for a company that competes with Siemens. - We do not engage in any activity that competes with Siemens. 1.

{"text": "The Project Business Excellence with the PM@Siemens methodology is the company-wide standard for project management developed in coordination with the Organizational Units. It defines the tasks, responsibilities and fundamental processes in project management and for project business. It addresses all important areas of Siemens' project management and describes the expectations for excellent project business across the entire life cycle, including the mandatory minimum requirements that must be met during acquisition and execution. The Limits of Authority (LoA) process is part of the PM@Siemens methodology. It defines when and at what level management decisions are required. It improves the quality of decision-making in the bidding phase (bid/no-bid) for each individual project. Compliance in Project (CiP) mainly addresses Limits of Authority (LoA) project types [Solution Business (LoA) Service Business (LoA)] with Compliance specific risks especially regarding Anti-Corruption, Anti-Money Laundering and Human Rights The Compliance in Projects (CiP) handbook chapter aims to ensure appropriate identification of risks during the pre-sales, sales and execution phase and adequate mitigation of these risks. General principles: - Projects must comply with the Siemens-internal regulations as well as the applicable local laws during the: - Pre-sales phase - For an early identification and mitigation of Compliance risks in the pre-sales phase, it is recommended to establish a regular dialogue between sales personnel and the Compliance Officer (CO) where potential Compliance risks are assessed and mitigated as early in the process as possible (pre-sales risk assessment) - Sales phase - A LoA Compliance Risk Evaluation (LoA CRE) is the core element of Compliance in the sales phase. A LoA CRE is part of the PM@Siemens LoA Tool which supports the identification of Compliance risks. - Execution phase - The identification of Compliance risks and mitigation during the project execution phase lies within the overall responsibility of the Project Manager of the execution phase (PM execution) with support from the responsible Compliance Officer. - The Siemens Project Manager - The responsible Compliance Officer will support the Project Manager whenever needed 2 . He has to be involved according to PM Guide 3 - Any Compliance concern arising throughout the project lifecycle must be communicated immediately to the responsible sales or project manager and the Compliance Officer (CO) . - Export control related risks are covered by the existing export control processes. 1. Already while developing a business opportunity (pre-sales), it is possible that un-identified or un-mitigated Compliance risks may lead to violations of applicable law. Potential violations may also occur prior to entering the Limits of Authority (LoA) process. General principles: - For an early identification and mitigation of Compliance risks in the pre-sales phase, it is recommended to establish a regular dialogue between sales personnel and the CO where potential Compliance risks are assessed and mitigated as early in the process as possible (pre-sales risk assessment) - This concept can be adapted in a risk-oriented manner by the Businesses/Countries. - It is very important that a risk which may occur in pre-sales is identified, and appropriately mitigated. - Further guidance on risk identification in the pre-sales phase is available here. A pre-sales risk assessment for business opportunities with an expected bid-volume exceeding €2,500,000 should focus on the following (examples but not limited to), if these risk areas exist - Legally binding commitments without a step-out clause - Involvement of 3rd parties to influence a project - Projects that raise the potential for a competition or antitrust risk situation (e.g. consortium with a competitor or a parallel bid by Siemens) - Risks associated to consortiums - Projects with AML Red Flags (chapter C 1) - Risks related to human rights violations - Financing projects - Projects with partners located in countries with increased export control risks - Cost sharing with partners - Highly complex business cases Many Compliance risks occur during the sales phase. Also, Compliance matters that occur during project execution often originate from the sales phase. General principles: - A LoA Compliance Risk Evaluation (LoA CRE) is the core element of Compliance in the sales phase. The LoA CRE is part of the PM@Siemens LoA Tool which supports the identification of Compliance risks. - Further guidance on risk identification is available in theProject Compliance risk landscape .

Furthermore this applies also for every project with a volume ≤ € 2,500,000 with the involvement of export credit guarantee, multilateral development banks, or multilateral financial institutions. The LoA CRE's purpose is to identify and document Compliance relevant risks and to define corresponding mitigation measures during the Siemens sales process up to PM040/PM070. Compliance risks are determined during the LoA CRE, approved and signed by the CO at PM040/PM070 and are included in the LoA risk report and Compliance risk summary for the LoA decision. The authorized project manager (sales phase) with support from the CO is responsible for the identification and mitigation of applicable Compliance risks. A LoA CRE is mandatory for all projects meeting the criteria in chapter H 1.2.1. of this document and with final review performed by the Authorized Compliance Officer (ACO) before the final LoA decision. The Compliance Summary provides a comprehensive overview on Compliance relevant information and will be archived in the PM@Siemens. Depending on the data provided in the key data section of the LoA, additional information may be required from the authorized project manager (APM). This documentation/evidence (e.g. results of internet searches, company information with regard to third parties, vendors, consortium partners, confirmations received by legal, contract management, and/or project commercial) must be included with the project documentation and made available to the CO. A Compliance risk class is automatically defined. The CO must have access to any Compliance related information in any project within his area of responsibility and participates in the decision process as defined in circular No. 182Limits of Authority (LoA) Process and Project Approvals. The APM initiates the LoA sign-off workflow, which triggers an automated email to notify the ACO. The ACO then reviews and clarifies the provided information and involves the CO of the respective escalation level (e.g. in cross border projects) to ensure comprehensive coverage of all Compliance risks. Mitigation measures are documented by the APM and ACO in the LoA CRE and are part of the LoA risk report. This includes identifying risks, mitigation steps persons assigned the implementation measures and timelines/due dates. During the sign-off the ACO may comment on Compliance relevant topics and add potential conditions for approval and measures to mitigate Compliance risks. Ideally, the agreed upon mitigation efforts should be implanted no later than the PM070 stage by the APM. Nevertheless, any measures and action items not completed shall be handed over and be dealt with during project execution phase. Note: If any identified risk has a status of RED before the LoA decision, PM040 bid approval will not be possible If any identified risks have a status of YELLOW before the LoA decision, the ACO must participate in the LoA decision. Management is informed about Compliance risks and proposed mitigation measures before LoA decision. An adequate level of Compliance risk clarification and mitigation has to be achieved by the involved parties. This ensures a sound basis for management decision. The LoA Update is performed according to circular No. 182Limits of Authority (LoA) Process and Project Approvals and the CO participates if required. If more than one Compliance Officer is involved in the project (e.g. for cross border projects) they should discuss the comprehensive risks identified for the project and align on further cooperation during the project execution phase starting with PM080. 1. General principles: - Compliance in the project execution phase (CiPE) applies to all projects selected by the Authorized Compliance Officer (ACO) as relevant to the project execution phase. The relevance selection by the ACO must be documented in the LoA tool during the sign-off process at the milestone PM070 for all projects with LoA CRE and won status. - If the ACO decides that a project is relevant for CiPE, then the resulting steps and activities are mandatory for the PM responsible during execution phase. - The CiPE process starts with PM100. - Irrespective whether a project is subject to the CiPE process or not, the identification of Compliance risks and mitigation during the project execution phase lies within the overall responsibility of the PM execution with support from the responsible CO. For any Siemens project with LoA CRE and status won the ACO decides about the CiPE relevance of the project", "metadata": "1. Compliance in Project Business-2"}
{"text": "as a mandatory risk mitigation measure. The selection of CiPE relevant projects is a mandatory process step at the sign off process at milestone PM070 in the PM@Siemens LoA tool. If the ACO decides that a project is relevant for CiPE, then the resulting steps and activities are mandatory for the PM responsible during execution phase. The PM should involve the ACO at any time during the project's execution phase for matters related to risk analysis and mitigation. During the project execution phase a project can be selected at any time as relevant for Compliance in project execution. It is in the discretion of the Compliance Officer to decide whether a project is relevant for the execution phase or not. If the selection is made after PM100, the meeting specified in H 1.3.2.1.must be held without delay. The meeting minutes should include the result of the review and must be included in the standard project documentation by the PM. Potential reasons which could lead to select a project as relevant for CiPE (after PM080) as a mandatory mitigation measure during the project execution phase can be for example: - Compliance concerns made by the PM/CEO/CFO/Responsible Business Manager during project execution - Business Partner shows increased risks (high-risk BP, BP under observation, etc.) - Customer demands the involvement of a specific subcontractor or intermediary without plausible justification - Risks or concerns raised as a result of an internal or external audit - Compliance investigation mandate related to the project - AML Red Flags (chapter C 1) arises For projects selected as relevant for Compliance in project execution according to this handbook chapter, the following measures are mandatory. Compliance risks and agreed upon measures for mitigation are documented in the project documentation according to PM@Siemens. Compliance Meeting The responsible CO initiates a meeting with the PM at the start of the project execution. (If the project is designated after PM100, this meeting must be held without delay). The Compliance meeting should occur as follows: - Compliance relevant risks during the project execution phase should be identified and if applicable, it should be started to define measures to mitigate these risks. (These measures may include collective action activities such as Compliance and integrity pacts in consortia or special purpose vehicles). - The Project Compliance Risk Landscape can be used to support the risk analysis. - To ensure the project adheres to local country Compliance requirements, the local CO of the project`s location should also be involved. Results/Monitoring The PM will include the results (e.g. risk mitigation measures, names of responsible persons, and timelines/due dates) of this meeting in the project documentation The PM regularly monitors whether the Compliance risks identified at the start of the project execution phase still exist or whether they have changed. This is done both ad-hoc and in line with the regular risk management cycle for projects. If a new Compliance related risk arises or an existing risk changes (or no longer applies), the PM notifies the CO and responsible business manager for agreement on adequate mitigation measures. The PM also regularly checks that the agreed upon mitigation measures are effective or still adequate and adjusts the measures accordingly if required. Results/Monitoring The PM provides evidence of the completed Compliance measures in the project documentation. The PM also provides the results of the evaluation in the standard Q-Gate documentation and informs the responsible CO. Prior to the PM600, the PM initiates a mandatory discussion with the responsible CO. The purpose of this meeting is to review the risk analysis H 1.3.2.1. with regard to the upcoming project's acceptance and define additional mitigation measures when necessary. Particularly emphasis should be on the acceptance tests and decision-making process within the customer acceptance framework. At least the following topics should be covered: - Is there any indication that an employee of the customer will demand an unjust advantage (e.g. cash payment or other benefit) in exchange for signing the customer acceptance documents? - Is there any indication that an employee of the customer will demand and unjust advantage for proceeding with the customer acceptance even though the technical specifications or test results do not yet fulfill Siemens' contractual obligations? - Is there any indication that an employee of the customer is deliberately delaying the acceptance preparations for no valid reason and is demanding an unjust advantage in exchange for ending the delays? - Is there any scrap or excess material left over that could be misused to create slush funds or otherwise used inappropriately? In addition, the PM and responsible CO will perform a final check with regard to the implementation of previously defined mitigation measures. Result/Monitoring The PM will include the result of the review in the meeting minutes and the final evidence of the Compliance measures in the project documentation", "metadata": "1.

Projects backed by a national export credit guarantee or financed wholly or partly by multilateral development banks or multilateral financial institutions A definition of the relevant financial institutions is given in the PM@Siemens LoA Tool. The applicability is also determined there. 6. Business Partners with red flags and BP CDDs under observation The project involves a Business Partner that is currently designated as under observation in the NextGen BPC-Tool (Business Partner Compliance tool) or to which red flags have been assigned. The current categorization of the Business Partner is stored in the NextGen BPC-Tool (Business Partner Compliance tool). 7. Suspicious behavior of the customer in the selection of a subcontractor or intermediary The customer issued an instruction for a subcontractor or intermediary (distributor or system integrator, for example) to be involved in the project without plausible justification. 8. Projects attracting a high level of public attention Circumstances under which designation can be required in individual cases include for example: - Infrastructure project with interregional importance - Construction progress pressure due to public attention (e.g. Berlin airport, Metro Ryad) - Complex projects/megaprojects - High level of media attention. 9. External consortium (open and silent consortium) Siemens is involved as a consortium partner in an open or silent consortium. 10. Projects for which unusual/unclear contractual agreements have been made with the customer regarding travel, FAT, accommodation, daily allowances, social responsibility - Unusual agreements relate, for example, to daily allowances that are inadequate, e.g. that differ significantly from the amounts agreed in comparable cases / exceed adequate usual local travel costs. - Unclear agreements are contractual terms that are ambiguous regarding the purpose of such trips or that grant the customer an extensive right to determine the justification for such trips, which customer employees should take part, or the class of air tickets/hotels to be reserved or other reimbursements without a legitimate business purpose. - Siemens involvement in social responsibility measures (sponsoring and donations or other contributions). 11. No Compliance organization in the country of project execution - There is no local Siemens Compliance organization in the country where the project is being implemented. - Compliance activities are controlled or implemented from the Business and/or from regional Compliance organizations in other countries. 12. Compliance preconditions for project execution are already defined in the sales phase (e.g. LoA decision). - Compliance risks were identified during the LoA Compliance Risk Evaluation, and corresponding mitigation measures defined (LoA Tool Risk Report). - The agreed mitigation measures have either not been implemented or are scheduled for implementation during the project execution phase. 13 Projects with Human Right risks - Projects with ECA/IFI involvement - Projects with indications/evidence of protest or controversies (especially in case of allegations of human rights violations raised through protesters) - Projects in conflict affected project execution countries (incl. pre- and post-conflicts) - Projects requiring more than small scale land acquisition or relocation of (members of) communities e.g. by customer or end-customer - Projects with indications/evidence of impacts on indigenous communities/peoples - Projects with major civil or construction work in scope of Siemens or a Siemens consortium partner - Projects with a project execution country having an extreme human rights risk country rating 1. ▌Compliance in Project Business Intranet ▌Collaboration in innovation projects one-pager ▌Collaboration in innovation projects Compliance checklist ▌Compliance in innovation projects training slides 1.

{"text": "This guidance addresses the Compliance Officers in Regions, OpCos and Corporate units. The implementation of the Compliance Ambassador approach is on a voluntary basis. Compliance Officers may decide whether to introduce the concept in their entity by themselves. The target of this Compliance Ambassador Guidance is to summarize, standardize and develop all the best practices in one common setup. Globally we will only use the term „Compliance Ambassador (CoA). Objectives of the Compliance Ambassador approach The Compliance Ambassador performs a voluntary support function as „local first line contact between Compliance Officers as trusted business partners and local employees to facilitate a successful and sustainable business. The Compliance Ambassador is a local point of contact for employees and the Compliance Officer. He or she answers employee's basic compliance questions (e.g. how to find information on the Compliance Intranet), supports compliance communication initiatives, and highlights potential risks or areas where Compliance training might be needed. He or she involves the Compliance Officers as necessary. Compliance Ambassadors should be role models for Siemens values and integrity in daily business and make an important contribution to our Compliance System. It is recommended that a Compliance Officer, who wants to introduce the Compliance Ambassador approach, takes into account the necessity, number of locations and resources etc. in close cooperation with the responsible management/business of the respective entity. In the process of introducing the Compliance Ambassador approach, especially the selection of appropriate colleagues, it is recommended that a Compliance Officer consults the relevant management of the entity and employee´s manager (manager of the potential candidate). Adequate platform for obtaining management´s approval for the implementation could be a Compliance Review Board meeting (CRB), if in place in the relevant entity. The selection of candidates could be agreed thereafter with the above mentioned parties bilaterally or in case of small entities as well within the CRB or another management team meeting. The Compliance Ambassador is not assigned to the Compliance Organization, but represents the link between his or her organizational unit and Compliance Officer, on a voluntary basis. The Compliance Ambassador takes on additional part-time responsibilities above his or her daily tasks and responsibilities that can be added to personal PMP targets, but at sole decision by the employee´s manager and the Compliance Ambassador. Headcount and related costs will not be charged to the Compliance Organization. Before starting, the Compliance Ambassador shall receive an official appointment letter upon nomination, and after terminating he or she shall receive a release letter. Appointment and release letters shall mandatorily be co-signed by the relevant Compliance Officer and the employee´s manager (or other management representative according to the signature regulations in the entity, e.g. CEO in smaller or Functional Head in larger entities). Compliance Ambassador shall also sign the appointment letter to confirm his or her consent to the appointment to his or her new role. It shall be mutually agreed by the above mentioned persons, for which period of time the Compliance Ambassador shall be appointed, whereby all parties should have the possibility of termination with an immediate effect. A possible template of the appointment letter as well as a release letter is available on the Compliance Ambassador workspace (see point 5 of this guidance). The following profile elements should be taken into consideration by the Compliance Officer when evaluating potential candidates for the role of a Compliance Ambassador: Knowledge and understanding: - adequate knowledge of the Siemens Compliance System, - adequate knowledge about relevant Compliance processes and policies in his or her local environment, - a good understanding of the processes in his or her business or functional environment, - sense of responsibility, well respected in the organization, - adequate experience in the relevant business environment, - access to Management of the respective organization, - overall understanding of the urgency of effective Compliance. Capabilities: - integrity, - embraces Siemens values, - effective communicator, - takes initiative, - power of persuasion, - ability to learn, - sensitivity to react according the priority / relevance of the situation. In general, the following tasks could be performed by the Compliance Ambassador in his or her area of responsibility: - answers questions about Compliance and passes on relevant questions to the Compliance Officer, - communicates the importance of all/relevant Compliance related topics within his or her community/function/department/work environment/project, - creates additional contacts between local employees and the Compliance Officers, - participates in team/project meetings, representing the relevant Compliance topics, - provides feedback and support on the updating and improving the Compliance System, - may participate as guest speaker during Compliance training sessions if agreed with the respective Compliance Officer and the trainer, as well as he or she may support in a co-trainer role the Compliance Officer / Management in conducting other trainings (e.g. Integrity dialog), - informs the Compliance Officer about Compliance related", "metadata": "3.

Therefore a Compliance Ambassador may not participate at trainings for the Compliance community like the CEP 1 or CEP 2 as above mentioned tasks are not covered by these trainings. The Compliance Ambassador may not perform any Compliance governance tasks, including, but not limited to the following: - review, release or approve business transactions from a Compliance perspective (e.g. SpoDoM, LoA, BPC Tool), - control or issue directives, - participate in Compliance investigations and clarifications as member of the investigation team, - represent Compliance in audits or operational reviews, - act as Control Requirement Contact (CRC), Deputy CRC for Compliance related controls - Compliance Ambassador might be appointed as an Independent Assessor with prior approval of the Compliance Officer. In order to ensure the necessary engagement with the Compliance Ambassador and to keep him or her up to date regarding its necessary knowledge, it is recommended, that the Compliance Officer: - evaluates the effectiveness of the Compliance Ambassador concept within his or her entity and, if necessary, take the required steps in order to change or adapt the concept to best suit its needs, - ensures that the Compliance Ambassador receives specialist guidance and regular information in order to stay informed about relevant Compliance related guidelines, circulars and processes, - motivates the Compliance Ambassadors to be engaged in his or her role, e.g. by ensuring that he or she receives first hand information, giving the possibility to network with other Ambassadors and showing off the Compliance expertise to his or her management. - supports the Compliance Ambassador in all questions and issues that might arise in connection to his or her role, - takes the initiative for regular individual meetings with the Compliance Ambassador and Compliance Ambassador community on a local level To fulfill his or her tasks the Compliance Ambassador has to receive adequate information about relevant topics. The Compliance Ambassador Program communication is supported by LC CB GF (Global Functions) and executed in close cooperation with OpCos / Countries/Corporate Compliance, especially LC CO RFC CA. As essential piece of the Compliance Ambassador communication, LC CB GF will provide a workspace at the LC Collaboration Platform named Compliance Ambassadors. The workspace fulfills the following main topics: - Workspace structure: Centralized storage platform All relevant information (information package and further communication measures, list of appointed Compliance Ambassadors, etc.) will be stored on the workspace centrally. Additionally, OpCos/Healthcare/ Countries/Corporate Compliance have a folder of their own to share entity specific information with the Compliance Ambassadors. Each Division/Healthcare/ Countries/Corporate Compliance unit is responsible for the administration of its own folder. Information Package for Compliance Ambassadors The main purpose of the information package is to support the Compliance Ambassadors with the latest compliance-related news in general. The package will be updated on a regular basis by LC CB GF based on input from LC CO RFC CA, OpCos / Countries/Corporate Compliance. All topics are addressing all Compliance Ambassadors – irrespective of the organization they belong to. The information package will be stored on the workspace in the folder 03 01 Information Package. Compliance Ambassadors can download the news and activate the auto-alert function. Training material on Compliance topics will be provided at the folder 03 03 Training Material. The OpCos/Healthcare/ Countries/Corporate Compliance are responsible for the administration of the Compliance Ambassadors workspace (concerning content and access rights for own Compliance Ambassadors). LC CB GF is responsible for technical support of LC Collaboration workspace. The OpCos/Healthcare/ Countries/Corporate Compliance introducing Compliance Ambassadors must nominate an overall contact person that acts as first line contact for the Compliance Ambassadors. An actual list has to be stored at the workspace in the folder 02 Ambassador Contact Persons. The OpCos/Healthcare/ Countries/Corporate Compliance are obliged to enter the names of appointed Compliance Ambassadors in the folder 01 Ambassador List on the workspace and update it accordingly due to personnel changes to ensure proper information flow. Due to the specifics of the strategic company Siemens Mobility its setup and environment there was a need of enriching the profile of a Compliance Ambassador (as described in in chapter 3 of", "metadata": "3. Ambassador program-2"}
{"text": "this webbook) by additional tasks. With this enhancement of the standard concept the Ambassador is of more value add for both, business and compliance organization. It is a real plus for the overall organization. The Ambassador plus supports business related tasks (additionally to tasks described in chapter 3) in the following manner: - Initial analyzing of internet findings related to business counterparts - Supporting bid mangers in performing the Compliance Risk Assessment - Supporting filling in the risk assessment of a CDD in the BPC Tool - Supporting the analysis whether an existing CDD may be used for a transaction - Supporting the execution of RIC controls (within the given boundaries – acting as Independent Assessor with prior approval of the Compliance Officer is possible) - Information of DP responsible persons about DP related risks, incidents and other topics. In order to enable the Ambassador plus to perform relevant tasks, he/she will - receive an education program for Ambassadors plus - be granted viewer rights in the (compliance) tools BP Next Gen, SpoDoM and LoA Live Tool - be invited to supporting communication channel in Yammer. Ambassadors plus should experience that their efforts are valued and appreciated.

{"text": "This chapter sets out the basic principles, rules and decision criteria to ensure due process and transparency in the disciplinary processes and the imposition of a reasonable, adequate, consistent and impartial response to non-compliant behavior. Siemens personnel who violate the laws and regulations and/or applicable Siemens policies including the Siemens Business Conduct Guidelines, while acting within the scope of their employment (non-compliant behavior) shall be subject to appropriate disciplinary consequences . Non-compliant behavior can result from action or the willful failure of action. Non-compliant behavior can also exist when a manager tolerates non-compliant behavior by a supervised employee or when a manager fails to promptly report and stop non-compliant behavior. Generally, a manager's failure to exercise proper supervision and organizational duties can amount to non-compliant behavior . Disciplinary consequences shall be evaluated and decided in disciplinary processes at central or local level . Co-determination rights of the employee representatives (if and where applicable) shall be respected throughout the applicable processes. Personal employee data shall be processed and transferred in accordance with applicable data privacy laws. Changes to the rules set out in this chapter are only permissible to the extent they are required by local law. LC CO IR RD must be notified in advance of any such changes. The appropriate response to non-compliant behavior is evaluated and decided either: - In a global disciplinary process at central level by the Central Disciplinary Committee (CDC), comprised of members of global top management, whose actions are based on rules set out in this chapter and in the CDC Charter in which significant parts of the CDC process are referred to LC CO IR RD (Regular CDC Process, see also section 4.2.1.1). - In an accelerated CDC Process by the responsible management along with the governing Human Resources Organization (HR Organization), whose actions are based on rules set out in this chapter and in the CDC Charter (Accelerated CDC Process, see also section 4.2.1.2). Disciplinary decisions that are made via the Accelerated CDC Process must be approved by LC CO IR RD. The CDC will be informed accordingly. - In general processes by the responsible management along with the governing HR Organization whose actions are based on the rules as set out in this chapter (see also section 4.2.2). The CDC jurisdiction applies as follows: - For employees of the Top Management (TM) group and ICFR Certifiers, the CDC shall have jurisdiction in all cases regardless of the nature and severity of the non-compliant behaviour. - For employees of the Senior Management (SM) group, CDC jurisdiction depends on the nature and severity of the non-compliant behaviour. The CDC will likely exercise jurisdiction where there are substantial violations of the BCG, particularly when the violations are related to anti-corruption or antitrust regulations or when they involve financial integrity rules, are systemic or have significant financial or reputational impact. For Supporting Certifiers, CDC jurisdiction is likely when the non-compliant behaviour impacts the supporting certifier's reliability. - For employees of the Non-Senior Management (NSM) group, the CDC will exercise jurisdiction only in excep­tional cases that present the potential for severe risks for the company (especially financial or reputational impact) . - Where CDC jurisdiction only applies to certain employees of a case, the CDC may exercise jurisdiction over all employees involved in the underlying case regardless of their categorization to ensure consistency and equal treatment of all involved parties. - To the extent permissible under local law, CDC members may direct certain cases to the CDC regardless of the involved employee's workforce categorization, if, in their discretion, the case implicates an important company interest. Non-compliant behavior within the jurisdiction of the CDC can be handled through the Regular CDC Process or the Accelerated CDC Process: - For employees of the Top Management (TM) group and ICFR Certifiers, the Accelerated CDC Process is generally not available. - For employees of the Senior Management (SM) group and Supporting Certifiers, the Accelerated CDC Process may apply, if the nature and severity of the non-compliant behaviour does not warrant CDC consideration in the Regular CDC Process. - For employees of the Non-Senior Management (NSM) group, the Accelerated CDC Process is generally appropriate. Determination of CDC jurisdiction LC CO IR RD is responsible for determining whether CDC jurisdiction applies in a particular case and whether the Regular CDC Process or the Accelerated CDC Process will be followed. This determination is generally only made after the fact-finding activities have been completed and a final written report has been submitted to LC CO IR RD. Execution of disciplinary measures 10 Disciplinary measures may not be executed until the fact-finding process has been finalized and the CDC's decision or recommendation has been issued, or after the required steps of the Accelerated CDC Process have been performed.

{"text": "exceptional cases, while fact-finding activities are ongoing, the execution of disciplinary measures (such as immediate suspension) could be warranted due to mandatory local labor law deadlines, to protect the ongoing investigation or for other reasons in the best interest of the company. Such exceptions require adherence to the rules and procedures of this chapter and may not be taken without the prior approval of LC CO IR RD. At its discretion, LC CO IR RD may direct the decision to the CDC. Role of LC CO IR RD The composition of the CDC and additional rules related to the CDC Processes are provided for in the CDC Charter. LC CO IR RD is the governance owner for the Regular CDC Process and the Accelerated CDC Process. In this role, LC CO IR RD may perform monitoring activities to ensure that the requirements of this chapter are carried out. The latter also applies in cases that have been investigated by LC CO IR CF / LC CO RFC LF and were assigned for disciplinary evaluation and decision in the General Disciplinary Processes. In cases where CDC jurisdiction does not apply, General Disciplinary Processes shall be followed by the responsible management along with the governing HR Organization, in accordance with the rules set out below. As a rule, the disciplinary evaluation and decision upon the appropriate response to non-compliant behavior shall be undertaken by the affected employee's manager/department head and the responsible local HR Organization. Cases with a potential wider impact shall be dealt with by the responsible higher-level management and the respective Head of HR. This especially concerns cases that present the potential for conflicts of interest. Upon notice to LC CO IR RD, the responsible management may establish disciplinary committees or other committees as evaluation and/or decision bodies (Local DC) with the CDC as benchmark. Local DC processes and procedures must be set out in a written charter that shall be guided by the CDC Charter and, at minimum, set out the following: - Members of the Local DC by title - Rules governing the role and involvement of the affected employee's manager/higher-level management - Jurisdiction of the Local DC - Meeting rules - Process to conclude on decisions/recommendations - Mechanisms for resolving (potential) conflicts of interest Management and HR organization Where the Local DC or higher-level management determines a disciplinary measure, the affected employee's manager and the appropriate local HR Organization must be sufficiently informed/consulted and shall implement the decision and consider how and to what extent the non-compliant behavior shall be reflected in the Performance Management Process (PMP) according to section 4.2.5. Involvement of the Compliance Officer If an investigation has been conducted by the Compliance Organization, the responsible Compliance Officer shall be promptly informed about the timeline for the decision and the execution of the disciplinary measures. All individuals evaluating and taking decisions in the Disciplinary Processes (collectively Decision Body) must thereby comply with the following basic principles and decision criteria: - The disciplinary evaluation and decision shall be reasonable, adequate, consistent and rendered without bias, partiality or personal interest. - All circumstances of the particular case, including the local legal framework, shall be considered. - A hearing of the employee conducted by individuals taking the disciplinary decision within a General Disciplinary Process and in the presence of the employee's manager or higher-level management shall be considered, particularly before any disciplinary measure in the form of a termination is imposed . The criteria for the hearing in the CDC Processes are provided in the CDC Charter. - The decision criteria as provided under section 4.2.3.2. of this chapter shall be considered to ensure consistency. - The disciplinary evaluation and decision need to be based on appropriately conducted and documented fact-finding. This fact-finding needs to comply with chapter 3 Code of conduct for compliance investigations and fact-finding and all other company policies and local legal requirements. Any indication of improper fact-finding shall be immediately and adequately followed up. - Employees who are in charge of and personally engaged in the fact-finding shall have no vote in the subsequent evaluation and decision on the disciplinary measure. An exception may be made in cases that are investigated by the relevant HR Organization if such cases do not require comprehensive fact-finding and no conflict of interest exists. - Actual or potential conflicts of interest or the appearance of conflicts of interest in the disciplinary process are not permitted and need to be resolved immediately. Actual or potential conflicts of interest may result, inter alia, from a personal or professional relationship between a member of the Decision Body and the subject employee and/or previous or current personal involvement by a member of the Decision Body in the facts/circumstances relating or leading to the non-compliant behaviour. - Employees who believe there is an", "metadata": "4.

If no local rules are established to address conflicts of interest, appropriate personnel would include their manager, the next management level or the governing HR Organization. As soon as such notification has been provided, the person/department addressed, in conjunction with the respective HR Organization, must promptly determine or seek advice with respect to whether a (potential) conflict situation exists and, if so, take appropriate action to ensure that the disciplinary process continues without any appearance of bias or partiality. Such action shall include the exclusion of the individual(s) from the disciplinary process and the nomination of an appropriate substitute. Disregarding the outlined principles and criteria may itself constitute non-compliant behavior and, if so, shall be handled accordingly. When deciding the appropriate response to non-compliant behavior, inter alia the following criteria shall be considered in the evaluation, if applicable: - Nature and severity of the non-compliant behaviour - Degree of participation - Duration and frequency of misconduct - Whether the employee was acting on instruction or through his/her own will - Intent or negligence - Self-enrichment or intention of self-enrichment - Extent of damage to the company - Period and course of employment - Relevant past non-compliant behaviour (labour law perspective) - Internal company factors and conditions that might have facilitated the non-compliant behavior - Time of the non-compliant behaviour and behaviour thereafter - Position level and role and responsibilities of the individual at the time of the misconduct - ICFR certification function at the time of the misconduct and at present - Candidate for and extent of amnesty - Cooperation and attitude during the fact-finding/disciplinary process - Self-indictment in whistle-blowing situations - Recognition of improper conduct by the individual - Standards set/measures taken in comparable cases The assessment of appropriate measure(s) in response to non-compliant behavior shall be made by the Decision Body.

Depending on the nature and severity of the non-compliant behavior, the following measures as laid down in section 4.2.4.1. - 4.2.4.6) are generally available to the extent they are permissible under local law. It is the responsibility of the affected employee's manager and the Head of the relevant HR Organization to ensure that an adequate record of executed disciplinary measures is maintained. Such record shall be maintained in the employee's personnel file, to the extent permissible under local law. If the Compliance Organization was responsible for the investigation of the non-compliant behavior, the Decision Body needs to decide whether or not the employee will have to participate in tailored online or in-person Compliance training or Finance training. Tailored in-person Compliance training or Finance training requires the involvement of the responsible Compliance or Controlling and Finance function. The employee's manager is responsible for ensuring that the Compliance or Finance training course is completed. Informal Warning An informal warning or other comparable measure under local law, which can be written or oral, is appropriate in cases of less serious non-compliant behavior that require some disciplinary response but less than a severe sanction. An informal warning consists of: (1) a description of the employee's non-compliant behavior, and (2) a clear direction with regard to the expected change in behavior for the future. As a rule, the informal warning shall be delivered in person by the employee's manager. Verbal warnings can be made in the presence of an HR representative, particularly where he/she took part in the disciplinary process. Formal warning A formal warning or other comparable measure under local law is appropriate in cases of non-compliant behavior that require a serious disciplinary response, but where it is reasonable to continue the employment relationship with the employee. A formal warning should consist of at least: (1) a description of the employee's non-compliant behavior and (2) a clear direction with regard to the expected change in behavior for the future, and (3) the announcement of further measures up to and including the termination of employment, if the employee does not change his/her behavior As a rule, the formal warning shall be delivered in person by the employee's manager in the presence of the HR representative who took part in the disciplinary evaluation process. The formal warning should be documented in writing. In cases of non-compliant behavior that require response measures in addition to a formal warning, potential appropriate disciplinary measures include the forfeiture or revocation of entitlements to variable pay (e.g. Senior Management Short Term Incentive) and/or voluntary remuneration elements (particularly the Siemens Stock Awards) for a defined period of time. The forfeiture of Siemens stock awards can only affect", "metadata": "4. Disciplinary Measures-3"}
{"text": "awards that have not vested at the time the disciplinary decision is taken. It shall also be decided whether new stock awards should be granted in the period following the execution of the disciplinary measure. The rules of this section shall also apply to other voluntary remuneration elements if they exist. It shall be determined whether non-compliant behavior warrants a transfer to another function as a side step or demotion. If such action is taken, adequate steps should be taken to ensure that such a transfer is not perceived as a promotion. In no case shall an employee be transferred to a function with a higher workforce categorization and/or a function with greater overall remuneration. Other measures in addition to or as an alternative to the measures provided under Nos. 1 through 4 above may include, but are not limited to, the following measures, which shall be limited to a reasonable period of time: - Suspension (with or without remuneration) - Exclusion from promotion - Exclusion from an ICFR certification function Additional measures can be official monitoring by a suitable senior manager or tailored training. If termination of the employee for non-compliant behavior is warranted, such termination may be ordinary termination or extraordinary termination. Ordinary termination Ordinary termination is appropriate in cases of non-compliant behavior that warrants termination because it is no longer reasonable to continue the employment relationship, but it is not necessary to terminate the employment utilizing extraordinary termination. An ordinary termination may provide for a statutory notice period or for a statutory severance payment under local law. Extraordinary termination Extraordinary termination (e.g. termination for cause, termination for gross misconduct or termination without notice period) can be appropriate in the most severe or repeated cases of non-compliant behavior. Non-compliant behavior requires sound management judgment from the employee's manager regarding whether or not, to what extent and for which time period the non-compliant behavior should be considered in the PMP. All cases of non-compliant behavior that warrant a formal warning or even more severe measures generally qualify for such consideration. Specific consideration should (if applicable) be placed on the employee's HOW evaluation, variable pay (target achievement) and development actions. These considerations and management decision need to be discussed with the relevant HR Organization prior to the Round Table discussion. Where the non-compliant behavior has an impact on the PMP, appropriate documentation of the behavior (not the disciplinary measure imposed) shall be added to the PMP feedback dialogue form . The employee's consideration in future PMP round table discussions and the possibility for the employee to be subject to remuneration increases and/or to a different potential statement in future PMP round tables depend on the severity of the non-compliant behavior and conduct shown by the employee thereafter. The responsible Compliance department requests from the relevant HR Organization anonymized data to allow the Compliance Organization an anonymized systematic internal reporting of non-compliant behavior and corresponding disciplinary measures . Selected data will also be used for external reporting. LC CO is responsible for defining the respective reporting categories and the details of the reporting process.

{"text": "As a general rule, Siemens is not responsible for minority shareholdings, as they are considered separate legal entities. Siemens can however be held liable for incidents in non-affiliated companies, even if Siemens does not hold a controlling interest in the company. Siemens can thus be held liable for incidents if Siemens has so called significant control of a minority shareholding. This requirement can be met in a number of ways, two of which are the number of shares that Siemens controls, and whether Siemens has the right to appoint a representative. However, reputational damage from incidents that happen in a minority shareholding may occur even if Siemens has a lower amount of control. Siemens is obliged to make at least good faith efforts to ensure that an appropriate Compliance system is implemented in the minority shareholding and to document such efforts. These efforts are partly taken into account during the acquisition of minority shareholdings with the Compliance Due Diligence (see Chapter I.2.2.). Siemens is however also required to ensure Compliance in the minority shareholding after the acquisition. Therefore, a necessary part of ensuring Compliance consists of the monitoring of minority shareholdings to ensure that appropriate measures can be taken if this should be necessary. Monitoring of minority shareholdings must happen on a risk-based approach. Relevant here is the risk profile of the minority shareholding and the amount of control that Siemens has over it. The general responsibility for monitoring Compliance in each Siemens minority shareholding lies with the relevant Siemens business / corporate function. If a Siemens representative is mandated as a board member of a minority shareholding, such Siemens representative will carry out this responsibility. Otherwise, the management of the relevant Siemens business / corporate function will be responsible. Monitoring of Minority Shareholdings – Overall principles - Siemens can be held liable for criminal actions performed in a minority shareholding if Siemens has significant control of the company. - The relevant Siemens business / corporate function is responsible for monitoring its minority shareholdings. If Siemens has the right to appoint a Siemens representative to a minority shareholding, this representative has to fulfill this responsibility. - LC CO RFC LF M&A supports monitoring of minority shareholdings and alerts the BU Compliance Officer of findings from its SETIS search. 1. 1. LC CO RFC LF M&A supports the Siemens business / corporate function by monitoring the minority shareholdings in the analytics platform SETIS. The monitoring of minority shareholdings in SETIS is performed using a predefined selection of keywords. This monitoring is performed regularly by LC CO RFC LF M&A, at least once a year. Monitoring results are archived in the SETIS tool. Potential Compliance red flags and other topics which may require further action are forwarded to the operational Compliance Officer. Upon request, LC CO RFC LF M&A will support by providing suggestions how to mitigate the identified risks. 1. An inherent risk with regard to minority shareholdings is that they are not given the attention they require, as there may be unawareness of their existence and of who is responsible for Compliance. It is therefore important to always be aware of which minority shareholdings are within the responsibility of the respective Compliance Officer. The ARE Masterlist should be consulted to attain an up-to-date view on the minority shareholdings within each BU. If a Compliance case, issue or topic within a Siemens minority shareholding comes to the attention of Siemens, appropriate Compliance mitigation measures should be assessed by the Compliance Officer responsible for the relevant Siemens minority shareholding and be addressed, i.e. recommended to the Siemens minority shareholding in question. LC CO RFC LF M&A offers assistance when required. 1. In some minority shareholdings, Siemens has the right to appoint a representative to the minority shareholding. This can be a board member or a member of the management. If such a representative is appointed, the representative has the obligation to monitor the Compliance situation in the minority shareholding. In the event of any substantial Compliance issues or topics within the minority shareholding, the representative must report this to the BU Compliance Officer. The representative will, in alignment with the BU Compliance Officer, communicate the required measures to the minority shareholding. LC CO RFC LC M&A offers assistance on request.

{"text": "Security incidents are caused by activities intended to damage Siemens and can be categorized as follows: - criminal acts (for example, theft, property damage, threats) - missing persons / extortion / kidnapping - civil unrest / armed attacks / terrorism - economic espionage - violations of travel security regulations. All employees are required to immediately report security incidents to the relevant security officers and/or in the tool IncidentReporting@Siemens (IR@S). GM SEC will support the relevant managers as needed. Effective January 1, 2020, all reporting to the CFO and CEO will be conducted by GM SEC. The suppliers contributing to the dataset will also receive access to the reports. The roles and responsibilities for incident processing and the related procedures are set out on the Incident Management homepage. Effective January 1, 2020, the TreuInfo compliance process will be superseded by IncidentReporting@Siemens (IR@S). Damages will be recorded in the Criminal Act template, which is accessible in the tool. In contrast to the previous definition of TreuInfo damages, there is a reporting obligation for all intentional damages (no lost assets) that occur to the detriment of Siemens AG or its Affiliated Companies and/or occur on the company's properties or projects (in this case also private property). This constitutes a fiduciary case. - For IR@S Cases the following criteria must be fulfilled: - an intentional act involving Siemens employees and/or third parties, and - an economic loss or material damage to the company´s property (no lost assets) or projects and/or - an economic loss or material damage that occurred on the company's properties or project sites. There is, in general, no threshold level for reports. As a rule, the value of a damage is equal to the replacement value in euros (where applicable, at the current exchange rate). For damages that arise outside GM SEC's area of responsibility (for example, in areas for which LC, SFS CO or HR are responsible), a template for recording key data will be provided by GM SEC. The incidents and damage amounts recorded in this template will be included in the overall report. For this reason, the department responsible for a particular case must have entered all relevant incidents in the template, at the very latest, by the time case processing is completed. Any changes in the individuals with authorized access must be reported to GM SEC. The change with respect to TreuInfo does not affect the registering procedure for Compliance cases as defined in the Compliance Handbook L. 2.1. These will still be registered in TRACI. Cases that are reported directly to GM SEC but also constitute Compliance cases will be forwarded by GM SEC to the Compliance organization for further handling. Which damages must I report as an employee? Any incident with damage which is 1. intentional The damage must have been caused deliberately. If an item is simply only lost (i.e. on a train, etc.) and there is no indication that a theft has occurred, no report is necessary, but other processes might apply (i.e. wipe device, report loss at lost and found, report lost information on device, etc.). and is 1. damage to Siemens assets Siemens property was affected by the incident. This can be the result of theft, but other damages are possible (i.e. through sabotage, vandalism, etc.) and/or 1. happens on a Siemens site or project Not only damage to Siemens is important to us. We want to know when an incident happens on a Siemens site or project even when private property is affected. The circumstance that there is crime on the site or project is relevant to us. There is no damage-threshold for reporting except for office material (e.g. printer-paper, toner, pens, etc.) which lies at 200.-EUR. Any damage must be converted into EUR according to the current exchange rate in order to maintain comparability. The damage value should reflect the replacement value or costs to restore the desired state of the damaged item. For items which cannot be replaced with an identical item (maybe due to only newer versions being available), the value of a comparable replacement or - if still available - the original purchasing price can be reported. Which damage must I report as Compliance, HR, SFS CO? Any damages which are not already reported as a Security Incident (e.g. resulting from a TRACI case, a HR investigation or Fraud investigation by SFS CO) must be reported using the template which was created for this use case. The template is only for damages resulting from cases which are handled by the above-mentioned entities and can be found in IR@S under Report Incident -> other templates -> Compliance, SFS CO and HR-Compliance Damage Report.

Under certain circumstances, providing or accepting Gifts and Hospitality could create the appearance of impropriety or even be considered as corruption. To minimize risks for employees and company related to benefits, every employee must comply with the following general principles and requirements when offering or accepting benefits: General principles – Gifts and Hospitality must - Be in accordance with applicable laws and regulations and mindful of internal rules that the recipient, especially government officials, might have. - Be provided or received in a transparent manner and correctly recorded in the financial books and records. - Be appropriate in terms of type, value, and frequency to the occasion and the position of the recipient. - Not be offered, provided, demanded, or accepted with the expectation of any type of advantage. - Never give the appearance of dishonesty or inappropriateness. In addition to our general principles - A prior SpoDoM-Approval is required for offering or granting invitations to Entertainment Events, reimbursement of Lodging or Non-Local Travel Costs, or Other Contributions without Consideration of a value of EUR 20,000 or more - to Government Officials and their Related Parties , Government Entities , Healthcare Providers, members of a purchasing department orbeneficiaries that are involved in important business decisions (Risk Groups), - if no exception applies. - No SpoDoM-Approval is required for offering or grantingGifts and Meals, reimbursement of Local Travel Costs, or for accepting Benefits. - Gifts of money are prohibited unless a prior written approval of the Compliance Officer is granted. 1. Gifts and Hospitality must not be offered, provided, demanded, or accepted with the expectation of any type of advantage. Employees must not provide or accept a gift or other benefit before checking it against our general principles. Already a promise or demand of Gifts and Hospitality with the expectation of an advantage (e.g. preferential treatment in competition with other companies) can be illegal. Gifts and Hospitality must never give the appearance of dishonesty or inappropriateness. Employees must refrain from any actions that could create an appearance of bad faith or inappropriateness, even if such actions are not illegal. Gifts and Hospitality must be in accordance with applicable laws and regulations and mindful of internal rules that the recipient, especially government officials, might have. The local rules of the country in which the benefit is provided is the starting point for evaluating compliance with applicable laws. If the recipient of the benefit does not live in this country, employees shall double-check the rules for the home country of the recipient as to whether any specific local rules apply, such as the prohibition of certain benefits or limits on the value of benefits. Most national laws require their nationals to adhere to the anti-corruption rules of their home country also when being abroad. National laws can vary considerably as to the prohibition of Gifts and Hospitality. In some countries, it may even be obligatory to comply with the internal rules of recipients organization, especially in the public sector (Government Officials and their Related Parties). Providing inappropriate gifts or hospitality to and their is prohibited and punishable by law. - Information to / Authorization by the Superior of the Beneficiary Local law or the internal rules, especially in the public sector, might also require that the superior of the beneficiary or a competent entity be informed or their authorization is needed. Depending on the circumstances and local standards, Siemens employees offering benefits should use appropriate, customized wording in their communication with the beneficiary, such as: - There might be special local regulations applicable to you in respect of the acceptance of these benefits. If you are unsure whether such regulations apply to you, please contact your local legal or compliance department or your superior and check if you are able to accept this offer. - Please do not forget to inform your superior and to obtain any authorization which might be required according to local laws and your organization's internal rules before accepting this offer. - When accepting this invitation, we assume that your participation in this event is in compliance with local laws and internal rules applicable to you and that you have informed your superior, if so required. - When accepting this gift, we assume that the acceptance of this gift is in compliance with local laws and internal rules applicable to you and that you have received the authorization of the competent entity in your organization, if so required. - This offer of … is conditional upon your compliance with all legal and other requirements for acceptance, including but not limited to anti-corruption laws.

Employees might also use an invitation and registration tool, if available, and insert appropriate compliance disclaimers. In the tool, the registration requirements can differentiate between private and public sector invitees by having the invitees certify that they belong to either sector, subsequently customizing the compliance disclaimer accordingly. For example, public sector invitees can be asked to certify actively that they have informed or received the authorization of their superior, whereas private sector invitees might just be hinted to the fact that Siemens assumes that the beneficiary complies with local laws and internal rules and has informed his superior. If appropriate, the employee might disclose the value of the in the invitation or offering. In addition, the employee might offer the beneficiary that he/she may choose to cover part of the costs, e.g. for accommodation and/or travelling to reduce the benefit to an amount which can be accepted by the beneficiary. Gifts and Hospitality must be appropriate in terms of type, value, and frequency to the occasion and the position of the recipient. The appropriateness of a benefit is judged based on all circumstances of the specific occasion, and in accordance with local law and standards. This encompasses the value of the benefit and the occasion on which it is offered, its frequency, the transparency with which it is processed and the position of the beneficiary, in particular whether the recipient will be responsible for making a business decision of significance to Siemens in the near future or has taken such decision in the recent past. The internal rules of the recipient's organization may also provide assurance as to what is considered appropriate under local standards. Gifts and Hospitality must be provided or received in a transparent manner and correctly recorded in the financial books and records. Employees shall confer the benefit in such a way that it is obvious to the recipient's employer, line manager or colleagues, and that its nature and value can be verified. Conferring a benefit in secret creates the suspicion of an improper motive on the part of the giver. Employees shall therefore send gifts and invitations to the business address rather than the private address of the recipient, and shall use the company letterhead for the covering letter. ! Please note: In case of benefits offered or granted jointly with third parties, the overall situation including the benefits offered or granted/financed by the third parties shall be assessed. ! Benefits are any economic and non-economic advantages which improve the recipients'/beneficiaries' position. Economic benefits are money or tangible non-monetary benefits such as or as well as Non-economic benefits are any other advantages. They may include, for example, a job or an internship for the recipient or the recipient's , the granting of a permit or an introduction to certain influential people ! A Gift is a present or something that is given to an individual without payment. Meals include food and drinks. Meals as Entertainment Events If Meals are combined with additional benefits, they might be considered an . In such case the Meal and any additional benefits must be handled in their entirety as an Entertainment Event. Gifts of Money Gifts of money encompass any benefit of a nature comparable to a monetary gift, for example, checks, shares, bonds or credit notes for a monetary amount, as well as vouchers for goods that can be redeemed in cash. Vouchers for goods that cannot be redeemed in cash, or fuel vouchers for a specific quantity of a specific type of gasoline are not considered monetary gifts. Gifts of money generally create the appearance of bad faith or impropriety. Therefore, such gifts require the prior written approval of the responsible Compliance Officer even where they are permitted under local law.

Travel and Lodging Costs for third parties are e.g. costs for inspection tours, acceptance visits, training. Exceptions The reimbursement of travel costs for job applicants is not considered a benefit for the purposes of these instructions. The same applies for occasionally and spontaneously driving employees of customers or other third parties or giving these persons a lift in one's own taxi. However, this exemption does not apply for arrangements to drive someone repeatedly. The reimbursement of travel and lodging costs incurred by a service provider that are necessarily implied in providing a service ordered by and performed for Siemens does not constitute a benefit in the sense of these instructions. Costs shall however only be reimbursed if reimbursement has been agreed in advance, for example by means of a contract or a purchase order. The same applies for conference speakers who have been invited to present a subject on behalf of Siemens on a conference or a congress. The reimbursement of these implied travel and lodging costs does not constitute a benefit in the sense of these instructions. However, specific regulations and reporting requirements may apply if the invited person works in the or is a . In such cases, must be checked or the responsible Compliance Officer shall be contacted. Specific Principles Besides the and possibly , reimbursing Travel and Lodging Costs for third parties shall comply with the following standards: - The reimbursement itself (instead of a payment by the third party itself), the number and function of the persons (e.g. few or many, with or without spouses) as well as the standard of the travel (e.g. economy or business class) and lodging (e.g. three or four star hotel) and their duration must be justified by a legitimate business purpose. - The costs need to be proportional compared to what is received in return (the standard of travel and lodging, the travelling duration, as well as number of travelling persons). - Cost reimbursements may not be made to private bank accounts or to individual persons or to third parties (other than the employer of the beneficiary) for forwarding to the beneficiaries. - Because travel agencies can be used to create slush funds, employees shall avoid reimbursement of costs for travelling or entertainment arranged by travel agencies for employees of the customer or other third party if Siemens has no sufficient control over the arrangements and their execution. In case the use of a travel agency is necessary, employees shall select agencies with high integrity and insist on an itemized, detailed proof of service and receipts of accommodation and travel providers. Local vs. Non-Local Travel Cost As local travel costs do not require a SpoDoM-Approval, it is important to distinguish between local and non-local travel costs. Crossing a country border does not per se imply that the travel must be considered non-local. In case the nearest transportation stop to or from a Siemens facility is nearby but in another country, the travel may still be considered local provided it otherwise fits into the criteria for local travel. An approval in the SpoDoM tool thus is not required if the employee of the customer or supplier must be brought to the nearest transportation stop (e.g. a taxi to the airport or train station) which happens to be abroad due to the location of the Siemens facility. Siemens regional companies may further define what falls under local travel for their respective country (for example with reference to a specific monetary threshold or a threshold regarding distance, means of transportation or otherwise). If there are various Siemens companies in the same country, the country specific definition shall be aligned among them. Country specific definitions of what is considered local travel shall be notified to the contact persons for gifts and hospitality at LC CO PT and LC CO RFC LF and shall be made available via the Compliance intranet.

{"text": "Siemens supports organizations and activities around the world through Sponsoring Activities, Donations, Charitable Contributions and Memberships (Contributions). The support of certain groups, institutions, projects and activities is an essential part of our communications programs and initiatives to strengthen the Siemens brand, of our company's social commitment as well as of its leadership in industry associations. Communications (CM) has strategic responsibility (governance) for Sponsoring Activities, Donations and Charitable Contributions, and Memberships. Insofar, this chapter serves for information purposes only. To bundle these activities in line with the relevant strategic objectives, to create transparency, to ensure compliance with all applicable statutory regulations and to strengthen control over the associated costs, Siemens has implemented the SpoDoM tool for registering and approving the activities. The Compliance Danger Sign questions to be answered in the SpoDoM tool in this context were fundamentally revised as of 01.10.2020. Compliance is now only included in the approval process for sponsorships and donations if the Danger Sign questions are answered positively. The approval sequence in the SpoDoM tool for all ARE is as follows: 1. Communications 2. Compliance (in case of positively answered danger sign questions) 3. Management 4. CM CUS (only for donations > EUR 20,000 and sponsorships > EUR 50,000). In agreement with the Siemens Business Conduct Guidelines, these Principles set out the mandatory requirements for the registration and approval of Contributions.

{"text": "This instruction describes the handling of Permanent Establishments (PE) from a Compliance point of view and focuses on Compliance risks and their mitigation. A PE is a legally dependent business form via which a non-resident company (parent/mother entity) establishes a presence in a country of activity. A PE arises de facto as a result of certain business activities of a parent entity (ARE) in an activity country different from its country of residence over a certain period of time. For Compliance risks in connection with PEs, see Chapter H. 7.1. Permanent Establishmentprinciples - Responsibility for PE throughout their lifecycle always lies with the legal parent entity (ARE). - The CEOs of the parent entity (ARE) have the main responsibility to ensure Compliance in their area of responsibility, including PE and business and projects executed via a PE. - The PE can only be closed after all (e.g. legal, Compliance, HR and tax) obligations have been fully met. The following instruction provides the main regulatory framework for business activities rendered abroad by Siemens AG and affiliated companies: - Financial Reporting Guidelines (FRG) Implementation Guidelines (Chapter 19, Permanent Establishments), - Siemens Circular No. 202 Compliance with tax requirements in case of cross-border business activities, and - Siemens Circular No. 206 Corporate Governance Rules for Siemens' Equity Investments For further details of responsibilities and governance of PE - please refer to the FRG Implementation Guideline Chapter 19. Scope This instruction applies to Siemens AG and affiliated companies executing business via PE (single-project PE, multi-project PE, branches and representation offices). This Instruction is addressed to all Compliance Officers (COs) and PE-Managers and aims to enable an understanding of the PE-Compliance relevant risks, regulations and related responsibilities. The aim is to ensure Compliance with Siemens Circulars as well as local and international laws and regulations. PE are being focused separately from a Compliance point of view since they may be located in countries that have high corruption, fraud, money laundering, antitrust, export control violation risks and are cross border in respect to the legal parent entity. In addition, potential further risks and challenges with regard to PEs may exist especially when setting up PEs such as: - Project PEs are sometimes in (very) remote locations, which can make it difficult to carry out certain Compliance tasks. - PEs often lack the usual Siemens IT systems and tools. - Siemens processes and controls are not always in place. - Often, PEs are not properly supervised because of the perception that (very) small entities pose little (or no) risk. - Multi-business project PEs can require considerable coordination effort between businesses. - Occasionally, the organization is not aware that a PE has been set up or exists. Examples of Compliance risks in a PE include: - PEs can be used as an agent to make illicit payments or to offer improper advantages to third parties - Breach of local law in personnel delegations (e.g. maintenance, engineering, etc.) - Lack of or poor due diligence activities for relevant business third parties and employees - Low awareness of consequences of Compliance breaches - Significant developments or changes within PE which may have an impact on the Compliance set-up are not considered, e.g. significant changes in the purpose of the PE. Thus, this instruction aims to guide PE Managers and COs to ensure Compliance in PE, detect and analyze potential Compliance risks of a PE and to implement the Siemens Compliance system. Responsibility for PE throughout its lifecycle always lies with the legal parent entity (ARE). CEOs of the parent entities have the main responsibility to ensure Compliance in their area of responsibility, including PE, business and projects executed via a PE. The names of the respective COs regarding PEs' parent entities (ARE) are clearly assigned and documented in the ARE Masterlist. The responsible CO should inform his management at least once a year about the level of Compliance maintained in the assigned PE e.g. during a Compliance Review Board meeting (CRB). Responsibility for handling of Multi-Operating Company project PEs A multi-project PE can contain several individual projects from different operating-, strategic-, etc. companies. Due to this, it is neither practical nor operationally possible to transfer the responsibility and assurance for Compliance, including all projects, exclusively to the CO of the parent entity Therefore, the COs of the organizational units of the individual projects are responsible to cover the Compliance risks on project level. The CO of the parent entity in this case just ensures that all the Compliance requirements for the PE shell itself are met. The Compliance risks defined by the CO and the PE manager and/or the CEO of the PE must be described and the responsibility for risk mitigation must be defined. The CO of the parent entity is also responsible for monitoring of the implementation. During", "metadata": "7. Compliance in Permanent Establishments-1"}
{"text": "a PE's life cycle, there are several tasks to be performed by the Compliance organization. The following chart presents an overview of the tasks for the different phases: Chart 1 Overview of Compliance tasks in the PE life cycle When a PE will be established, this PE must be reviewed to identify the needs and scope of Compliance services. In order to enable a focused and risk-oriented analysis, a pre-selection of scope is recommended which takes into account the structure and field of activity of the PE. Compliance risks inherent with a PE are typically linked to three criteria, which in general increase the risk at a PE: - External employees being directly employed by the PE - Business partner directly engaged by the PE - Local bank accounts under control of the PE If one of the above criteria is fulfilled according to the pre-check chart below, then a detailed risk assessment is required. A schematic diagram on how to proceed with such a pre-selection is shown here: Chart 2 PE Pre Check: Process to identify and mitigate Compliance Risks in a PE When applicable, the PE Manager should approach the CO of the parent company in order to start this process, as the PE Manager is the first one who becomes aware of developments or changes. In this liaison, the PE Manager and CO of the parent entity have to clarify: - The relevant Compliance topics which apply to the PE. - The understanding of the relevant PE employees about the applicable Compliance circulars, tools and processes. - Any critical, potential Compliance risks and their proper handling as per our rules and regulations. Based on the pre-selection, the affected fields of activity are to be analyzed further with a detailed questionnaire, an example can be found here: PE questionnaire Based on the results, the CO of the parent company in cooperation with the PE Manager is in charge for defining the scope of the Compliance services and describing the possible Compliance risks as well as mitigation measures. To the extent necessary, the CO of the parent entity as well as the PE Manager can nominate other person(s) to be involved in or take over the clarifying, e.g. PE Coordinator, Project Manager, Regional Compliance Officer, CO in the country of activity, etc. Since the PE develops during its life cycle, it is possible that an assessment for the PE may have to be repeated on a regular basis. In the event of major changes in the PE, the PE manager should contact his CO proactively to evaluate potential risks. Therefore, regular communication between the PE Manager and CO of the parent company is crucial. It is to be ensured that the existing and newly identified risks have been described and properly mitigated and it is to be checked if the need for Compliance services has changed. Particularities for PE personnel Special attention lays on the training of the PE staff in the country of activity. To ensure this, the PE manager should inform the responsible CO asap if personnel recruitment is planned or carried out during the course of the project execution or the PE life cycle. Like every Siemens employee, PE employees must be trained in Compliance relevant topics and understand the Compliance risks, relevant circulars, tools and processes. It is the responsibility of the responsible CO to assess whether risk-based training of PE employees is further necessary. In particular, the PE employees and staff should be able to identify critical Compliance topics and risks and bring them to the attention of the responsible CO for handling and / or mitigation. The PE Manager initiates this process upfront PE closing by contacting the responsible CO. The PE can only be closed after all (e.g. legal, Compliance, HR and tax) obligations have been fully met. Before the closure of the PE, a review regarding all Compliance-related issues has to be conducted to ensure that there are no open or pending Compliance topics. The responsible CO has to state the PE status regarding Compliance matters and verify that there are no open Compliance tasks. In the event that there are pending investigations concerning the PE, the CO of the parent entity will inform Case Handling (LC CO IR CF) so that case-related issues, if any, can be taken into account before PE closing. In addition, the CO of the parent entity will check with Discipline and Remediation (LC CO IR DR) that there are no open discipline and remediation tasks.

Executive Export Control provisions which change the content of the Siemens Circular 226, and the binding ICP EX instructions are not permitted, unless the deviation is mandatory for legal reasons. Insofar, the Portfolio Management Process has to be complied with according to Chapter 3.2 of the Compliance Operating Model. The Company Unit and country-specific working instructions are available on the intranet of the particular unit and - as existent - generally linked within the ICP EX. Export Control Obligation for all employees All employees are obliged to comply with the applicable legal requirements and internal regulations for Export Control. In addition, all employees who are designated a U.S. person must comply with the US sanction regulations applicable to them. These rules apply not only to employees who are directly and indirectly involved in the delivery of goods and services. Regardless of the sanctions that could be imposed by law, infringements of the legal requirements can lead to disciplinary measures. The legal requirements and the Siemens-internal regulations regarding Export Control must be observed. In essence, these Export Control regulations are contained in the ICP EX providing detailed instructions for - Export Control in Business processes - End-use and product related Export Control regulations - Export Control regulations for technology transfer and technical support - Embargos - Export authorizations. Export Control Tools The standard processes published in the ICP EX are supported by uniform corporate IT solutions. The use of the corporate IT solutions and their standardized integration in the ERP systems of the company is mandatory: The use of DAMEX (Data Automated Export Control System) Tool for SAP R/3 systems and of the AEB tool for SAP S4 systems is mandatory. Moreover, further corporate IT solutions such as LACOS (License Administration and Control System) and GLORIA (Global Risk Assessment) are mandatory within their scope of application. Furthermore, the designated reporting tool has to be used, currently MONA (Monitoring Application). The development and implementation of the Corporate IT solutions is carried out by LC CO PT EX in coordination with LC CO EX. Responsibilities for Export Control within a company are associated with executive management positions and a designated export control organization. If necessary, the German affiliated companies appoint their own ECO within their management board or ECC in coordination with LC CO. The regulations regarding ECO and ECC apply accordingly. Export Compliance Officer In accordance with administrative regulations a member of the Management Board of Siemens AG is appointed as Export Compliance Officer (ECO) of Siemens AG. The ECO has the necessary rights to carry out the dele-gated tasks, in particular unlimited authority to issue directives in the area of Export Control for all Siemens units. The ECO has tasked LC CO with the implementation of the tasks connected therewith. In due consideration of the regulatory framework of corporate law the ECO receives direct access to all business units and the specific legal position for the area of Export Control. He is responsible for imposing binding regulations regarding organization, business processes,", "metadata": "F. Export Control-1"}

Within this framework the ECO is authorized to prohibit individual business transactions. The Legal and Compliance Export Control department (LC CO EX) is assigned to the ECO for the execution of his tasks. Export Control Commissioner and LC CO EX The head of the department LC CO EX is also the Export Control Commissioner (ECC). He reports to the ECO and the CCO (Chief Compliance Officer) and has unlimited access to both. The ECC has unlimited authority in all matters concerning Export Control at all Siemens units and is also authorized to prohibit individual business transactions. LC CO EX has the worldwide authority to issue binding instructions on Export Control and sets out regulations concerning the organization. This includes in particular - developing, implementing, enforcing, monitoring and controlling the ICP EX and other relevant Siemens internal regulations and processes in force, including the associated Corporate IT solutions - employee selection and training, information obligations to the ECO concerning Export Control activities to the appropriate extent. Compliance Officers and EX Business Partners The respective Compliance Officers of the Company Units must designate a person with responsibility for Export Control in their LC CO unit. They also appoint the Export Control Business Partner of the respective CEO. In exceptional cases and in conjunction with LC CO EX the Export Control tasks of the Compliance Officer may be delegated to other Siemens units. Compliance with the applicable legal requirements for Export Control and the corresponding internal Siemens regulations must be ensured by the LC CO unit and by the CEOs of the Siemens Businesses, Corporate Functions, Business Units, Countries and Regional Units within their business responsibility according to Chapter 4.1 of the Compliance Operating Model. According to this, CEOs are obliged to implement internal Siemens regulations, in particular the ICP EX, in close cooperation with the respective LC CO unit and to integrate them into the operative business activities and processes (e.g. Sales, Logistics, and Research and Development). The export control organization fulfills various tasks that support an internal control system that satisfies the requirements of regulatory authorities. Some of these tasks are coordinated with other departments of the legal compliance organization. Employee selection and training To ensure sufficient and qualified personnel resources for the Export Control function, specific regulations for the employee selection and training exist. These must be taken into consideration both in personnel and development planning, and when filling positions. Further information can be found on the Compliance Training Intranet site. Monitoring LC CO is authorized to conduct regular checks on the proper implementation of the ICP EX and other Siemens-internal regulations concerning Export Control in all affected Siemens units. In addition, ad-hoc checks can be made at the direction of the ECO, ECC or CCO. The LC CO units perform internal checks for their area of responsibility as defined in the ICP EX as well as the Compliance Operating Model. Reporting To ensure the necessary flow of information, the Compliance Officers inform the relevant responsible CEOs or heads of Corporate Functions in the course of the CRB or on an ad hoc basis. These reports must be sent to LC CO EX at the same time. Furthermore, all audit reports and verification orders relating to Export Control, as well as the corresponding official reports, investigations and other official measures, must immediately be communicated to LC CO EX to enable them to fulfill the control obligations. Detailed information can be found in the ICP EX as well as the Compliance Operating Model. Training material for export control can be found in the ICP EX section Training and the Compliance Training Marketplace Export Control.

{"text": "The rules on the prohibition of corruption also apply without exception to so-called facilitation payments, as these are equally detrimental and usually pave the way for even more serious corruption issues. At the same time, Siemens has an obligation to ensure safe working conditions. General principles - Facilitation payments are prohibited. - However, no employees are expected to risk life, limb or liberty in the course of performing their duties. Unjustified payments under duress will not be punished with disciplinary action. - They must be reported in accordance with this section which also contains more detailed guidance. Definitions: A facilitation payment is the payment of a relatively small amount of money or the granting of any other benefit to usually low-ranking government officials, for their own personal benefit, with the aim of speeding up the performance of an official act to which the person making the payment/granting the benefit is entitled. This means that the government entity concerned would perform the official act in the same form and in any event, without payment to the government official (including, for example, granting approval where all preconditions are satisfied). Both legally protected interests must therefore be considered when a situation of duress for Siemens employees arises. A situation of duress is a situation in which employees have no alternative but to make an unjustified payment in order to protect themselves or others against the threat of death, injury or loss of personal liberty. The threat must be tangible and manifest. A theoretical possibility does not qualify as duress . Loss of personal liberty applies where there is a threat of imprisonment or comparable sanctions . Facilitation payments are prohibited by law in practically all countries as a form of corruption. Legal exceptions in certain jurisdictions (such as Australia, South Korea and the USA) do not legalize facilitation payments as such, but merely exclude criminal prosecution, for example by the US authorities for facilitation payments effected outside the USA. Facilitation payments to government officials in the USA are forbidden and liable to criminal prosecution. All Siemens employees are prohibited from offering, promising or making facilitation payments . No such authorization will be granted. The same applies to payments or the granting of other benefits of comparable characteristics and with a comparable purpose to private commercial counterparties. This prohibition may not be circumvented by making facilitation payments indirectly through third parties . When working with third parties, employees must therefore look out for any indications, for example on invoices, that such third parties may have made or may be making facilitation payments in the context of their activities for Siemens. In many jurisdictions, a payment under duress is not deemed an act of corruption. In other countries, a situation of duress is at least recognized as justification or as grounds for exemption from punishment. Correspondingly, no Siemens employees are expected to risk life, limb or liberty in the course of performing their duties. Unjustified payments under duress will therefore not be punished with disciplinary action under the following conditions: - Any employee should ask the person demanding the payment to explain the legal basis for the demand and inquire whether an official account or receipt will be issued for the payment . - If it becomes evident that the payment demanded most likely constitutes a facilitation payment, either because there is no plausible legal basis for such payment or because the government official refuses to issue an official invoice or receipt, the employee should oppose the demand as strongly as possible. - If a situation of duress arises, it is permissible to yield to the request to make a facilitation payment. Expenditure in connection with facilitation payments is generally not reimbursed to employees or third parties acting for Siemens . Provided that - the employee has complied in full with the applicable reporting and documentation obligations and - there are no specific circumstances indicating that the employee is at fault in connection with the payment, disciplinary action will generally be disproportionate because the employee will have allowed Siemens to meet its statutory documentation duties. The request to make the payment must be reported to the responsible Compliance Officer without undue delay. The same applies if a third party acting for Siemens is suspected of having made facilitation payments or payments under duress in the context of its activities for Siemens. All facts must be recorded as soon as possible after the incident in a brief written report. This report must be submitted to the responsible Compliance Officer. The Compliance Officer reports the incident in TRACI under the Active Corruption category, subcategory Public Corruption Active. To allow for easy identification, FP should be added in front of the case name . In the case of a payment by a third party acting for Siemens, the", "metadata": "3. Facilitation Payments-1"}

The Compliance Officer informs the management of the Regional Company and the General Counsel as soon as possible of every incident. The management of the Regional Company decides in consultation with the General Counsel and the responsible Compliance Officer whether the incident should be reported and, if so, to which local authority. The management, together with the General Counsel and the Compliance Officer, decides on any further proceedings with the authority that requested the payment . The responsible Compliance Officer advises the management of the Regional Company with regard to potential countermeasures for the future. Payments made under duress can be accounted for and reimbursed (for employees, this takes place within the framework of the travel expense reimbursement procedures), provided that - the employee has properly documented a situation of duress and - the responsible Compliance Officer has confirmed the situation of duress. The responsible Compliance Officers provide risk analyses concerning the occurrence of facilitation payments in their respective areas. They ensure that employees particularly exposed to risk receive appropriate training, with special regard to correct conduct in situations of duress. All incidents must be reported immediately by the responsible Compliance Officers to Chief Compliance Officer and the Chief Counsel Compliance. Further information can be found on the Facilitation Payments Intranet page. - Quick guide Do´s and Don't´s The following quick guide summarizes the Do´s and Don't´s in terms of facilitation payments and shows which behavior is suggested in this context and which should be avoided if possible: - General recommendations for avoiding facilitation payments Furthermore the General recommendations for avoiding facilitation payments can give more information in which general recommendations are given, on how to behave overseas in order to avoid a payment claim, how to react when faced with such a demand and how to proceed when the required payment cannot be avoided. - Siemens Emergency Hotline (+49 89 636 12345) Should a Siemens employee, during a business trip or business stay abroad, find himself in the situation of being asked to make a facilitation payment, he can obtain suitable 1st level support by calling the Siemens Emergency Hotline. - Facilitation Payments as an awareness topic for Siemens Additional information based on a concrete case study on the subject of facilitation payments as an awareness topic can be found in the presentation Awareness Topic Facilitation Payments. - Transparency International – Global Corruption Barometer Detailed information on corruption can also be found in Transparency International´s Global Corruption Barometer. - TRACE - Compendium Further information of international anti-bribery enforcement actions can be found on the user-friendly and fully searchable database TRACE Compendium. - Transparency International - CORRUPTIONARY A-Z The Transparency International Glossary can give you more detailed information on various anti-corruption topics.", "metadata": "3.

{"text": "A reliable risk analysis is key for the success of planned Siemens business goals and strategies. It is also the foundation of the Compliance System. Recognizing risks at an early stage helps management to make informed decisions whether to avoid, reduce, transfer or accept certain compliance risks. One of the prerequisites for proactively managing those risks is to create transparency in relation to the overall risk environment by evaluating the business exposure, openly and self-critically, to defined Compliance risk areas such as, but not limited, to: Anti-Corruption, Antirust, Export Control, Anti-Money Laundering and Data Privacy within the Entity. The Compliance Risk Assessment (CRA) is one element of the Compliance Risk Management process. It targets a bottom up evaluation of local risk environment in each Siemens Entity worldwide through the CRA workshop. During the CRA Workshop CEOs, relevant managers, and Compliance Officers meet to systematically determine and assess compliance risks on their respective companies. CRA results are then incorporated in the group-level compliance risk analysis. The latter aims to identify systematic and globally recurring compliance risks as quickly as possible. The group-level analyses consider additional factors, such as insights from compliance controls and investigations into specific cases. The corporate compliance risks are derived from the consolidated results, which are shared with the company's business Entities. Relevant risks are reported to the company's Enterprise Risk Management (ERM). Risk-reduction measures are drawn up and implemented. These measures are registered and monitored in the CRA Tracking tool. If significant or major risks arise during a year, the responsible CO reports these risks to LC CO RFC RC directly via e-mail and in the CRA Tracking tool. This Ad-hoc risk reporting does not replace Ad-hoc ERM reporting. The progress of the derived mitigation measures must be monitored regularly, at least twice a year by the respective Entity Compliance Officer, for example, in the Compliance Review Board (CRB). Besides the CRA Workshop (see Chapter 1.6.2), the CRA process includes an AREA - Antitrust Risk Exposure Assessment (see Chapter 1.6.1) for relevant Entities (see Chapter 1.4) to perform a top-down / bottom-up risk analysis. Both processes are combined and described in this CRA Handbook. The purpose of this Handbook is to describe how to perform the CRA Workshop and AREA as well as how to define mitigation measures for the identified compliance risks. It also defines the scope and respective frequency. CRA AREA - The goal of the CRA is to evaluate compliance risks within Siemens and to define mitigation measures accordingly. - Moreover, the CRA creates an awareness of compliance risks, emphasizes the responsibility of the entity CEO and management in general for compliance-related topics and strengthens cooperation between the Compliance organization and the business entities. - The CRA process requires, among other things, out-of-the box thinking and input that should be collected by Compliance in an organized fashion from observations in the course of the two-year CRA period . - The AREA aims to identify the antitrust risk level of the various Siemens entities in a bottom-up manner and to define appropriate follow-up measures. It is carried out by management with the assistance of Legal and Compliance. - The implementation of the appropriate (i.e. risk-based) follow-up measures contributes to minimizing antitrust risks across the Siemens Group. The CRA Workshop supports the CEO and the respective management in: - Identifying potential compliance-related risks (resulting in direct/indirect liability, reputational harm) beyond those already mitigated by existing compliance circulars, tools and controls - Incorporating company experience from investigations, audit findings and other deficiencies to identify potential sources of compliance-related risks - Deciding whether to avoid, reduce, transfer or accept certain compliance risks - Determining appropriate ways to limit the impact of certain risks those risks (mitigating actions) - Creating awareness of a compliance risk culture, supporting the CEO on his/her responsibility for risk management and compliance-related topics - Gaining a clear understanding of possible underlying compliance risks related to anticorruption, antitrust data privacy, anti-money laundering, human rights and export control. - Strengthens cooperation between the Compliance organization and the Business Entities. CRA Workshop The Entity CEO is responsible for the CRA Workshop execution as well as for the definition of the relevant mitigation measures, thus for the CRA Workshop results. The Compliance Officer (CO) of each applicable Entity and Region is responsible for coordination and preparation of the CRA workshop (with support and input from the relevant Regional Experts on risk identified, e.g. antitrust expert for AREA aspects). The CO also reports the workshop results to the Risk Management and Controls department (LC CO RFC RC) and is responsible for tracking and monitoring the implementation status of any defined mitigation measures. Management's proximity to the business renders it close to potential compliance risks, thus Management's input is, therefore, a key source for every risk assessment process.

The Antitrust Risk Assessment (AREA) must be executed as a mandatory element of the CRA Workshop as described in Chapter 1.6.1 In odd years, the so-called Top Risk Countries are required to perform a CRA Workshop. The CRA workshop results must be documented by the end of Q1 of the Fiscal Year. Note that in order to support the worldwide responsibility of the Operating Companies for their business, the Region CRA workshops (refer to Chapter 1.4) shall be scheduled first, in October/early November and make the CRA Workshop results available in mid-November for use in the Operating Company CRA's. The Company CRA workshops (refer to Chapter 1.4 ) shall perform their CRA's in late November/December. The progress of the derived mitigation measures must be monitored regularly, at least twice a year by the respective entity, for example, in the Compliance Review Board (CRB, refer to Chapter K. 2.). The CRA process is divided into six steps. Each step is described in more detail in the following chapters: Step 1 (Details see chapter 1.6.1 AREA, not applicable for Top Risk Countries when performing a CRA in odd fiscal years): The AREA is the first step that must be taken. The AREA aims to identify the antitrust risk level of the various Siemens Entities and to define appropriate follow-up measures. It is carried out by management with the assistance of Legal and Compliance. Step 2 (Details see chapter 1.6.2 Workshop Preparation): The second step Preparation aims to reunite supporting information and key facts to support risk exposure discussions with management. The Entity responsible CO reviews the previous CRA results and defines the frame conditions by analyzing data from different internal and external sources (such as previous or pending cases, reviews and external audits), conducting interviews and preparing the workshop slides (with input from the relevant Regional Antitrust Experts on antitrust/AREA aspects) with key hypotheses and risks agreed with the CEO of the entity. Step 3 (Details see chapter 1.6.3 Hold Management Workshop): The CEO is responsible for the CRA results and emphasizes this responsibility by issuing invitations to the CRA workshop.

{"text": "are transferred to ERM, if applicable. Step 5 (Details see chapter 1.6.5 Measures Implementation): Focus on the response plan. A tool is provided and serves two purposes. Firstly, it serves as input for the further analysis of compliance risks on an aggregate level by LC CO RFC RC. Secondly, the CRA tracking tool can be used by the entity to implement the response plan and monitor the mitigation measures. The results of the CRA and the mitigation measures, as well as the implementation of the latter, must be discussed and monitored regularly (at least twice a year) during Management Meetings (such as CRB). Step 6 (Details see chapter 1.6.6 Transfer to ARE): Finally, the CRA results are transferred to the AREs. Within the AREs, management reviews the CRA results and implements mitigation measures if applicable. In the case of newly identified risks that have not been reported by the CRA Entities and CRA regions so far, should be reported by the responsible CO of the ARE accordingly. To conduct and Antitrust Risk Exposure Assessment (AREA) is the first step that must be taken. The AREA aims to identify the antitrust risk level of the various Siemens Entities and to define appropriate follow-up measures. It is carried out by management with the assistance of Legal and Compliance. The AREA Step 1. is not applicable for Top Risk Countries who only perform a CRA workshop, consisting of Steps 2 to 6 in odd fiscal years: The following figure provides an overview of the process step Conduct AREA. 1. Instruct sub-levels: The relevant OpCo CO, Corporate Country CO (for China and India) and the Lead Country CO inform the relevant COs responsible for the entities listed in 1.4 above about the current AREA process and the tasks to be performed. The COs responsible for Regional Companies inform the relevant Regional Antitrust Expert accordingly. 1. Prepare Meeting: The respective CO responsible for the entities listed in 1.4 above must prepare the AREA meeting together, in the case of Regional Companies, with the relevant Regional Antitrust Expert. He can optionally discuss in advance the antitrust-related questions contained in the Excel template (see risk department or LC M&A CMP homepage) with the General/ Legal Counsel and selected Key Support Functions. As a further preparation step, the Business Unit/Regional Company CO together with the Regional Antitrust Expert must review antitrust-related cases in TRACI within his area of responsibility. 1. Conduct meeting: During the AREA meeting, the antitrust-related questions must be answered, and the CEO is required to sign the results. 1. Define measures: Completion of the questions in the relevant AREA template will result in an overall antitrust risk rating of low/medium/high. Based on this rating, management is required with the assistance of Legal and Compliance to determine, implement and document appropriate follow-up measures (recommended measures are provided on risk department / LC M&A CMP homepage). The defined follow-up measures can also be used for CRA mitigation measures. Please note that if a high antitrust risk has been identified, LC M&A CMP and LC CO IR must be consulted prior to determining the appropriate follow-up measures. In all other cases, LC M&A CMP and LC CO IR may choose to verify any entity's bottom-up risk assessment and follow-up measures in a top-down approach. The Monitoring Sheet provided on risk department / LC M&A CMP homepage can be used to monitor the implementation progress of defined follow-up measures. 1. Report results : Finally, the Excel file containing the AREA results must be sent by encrypted email to LC M&A CMP using the following email address (area-results.legal-compliance@siemens.com) and indicating in the subject line which entity the AREA results relate to. Once the Excel file has been sent to LC M&A CMP, the original signed document should be filed locally. For further information on the AREA and the applicable AREA templates please consult the LC M&A CMP intranet homepage or the Q&A (see risk department / LC M&A CMP homepage). The second step Preparation aims to reunite supporting information and key facts to support risk exposure discussions with management. The responsible CO of the entity (with input from the relevant regional risk topics experts) reviews previous CRA results and defines the frame conditions by analyzing data from different internal and external sources (such as previous or pending cases, reviews and external audits), conducting interviews and preparing the workshop slides (with input from the relevant regional risk topics experts) with key hypotheses and risks agreed with the CEO of the entity. The respective CO is responsible (with input from the relevant regional risk topics experts) for the preparation of the CRA workshop, whereas the CEO is responsible for the CRA results. The CEO should therefore be informed about the critical points of the analysis during the preparation phase. In general, only", "metadata": "1. Compliance Risk Assessment-3"}
{"text": "the risk and mitigation measures from the previous CRA and the previous AREA results are mandatory input, but (for thorough preparation) other inputs are recommended in order to obtain a complete picture of the compliance risk situation. Central material has been prepared and can be used to facilitate discussions with the responsible risk owners. These materials will be part of the training sessions. 1. Previous CRA results: Review mitigation measures taken, especially if they are still open. The CO and the CEO decide for each open response measure from the previous assessment whether to close it or to transfer it to the new CRA risk identification. 2. Previous AREA results: The last available AREA should feed into the CRA preparation phase. For further information on the AREA and the corresponding AREA templates, consult the LC M&A CMP intranet homepage. The goal is to perform an analysis of the business activities and processes in order to understand the possible underlying compliance risks. It is highly recommended that the responsible CO (with input from the relevant regional risk topics experts) analyzes any information and reports he may already have on hand. This helps to refresh the awareness of the compliance topics already addressed through circulars and tools. The last step before the management workshop is to concentrate the analysis on certain key statements and to focus the risk identification on certain risk areas. The risk areas provide plenty of risk examples and potential mitigation measures. Specific risk descriptions that don't fit into predefined risk areas can be described under the risk area Individual risks (see CRA training slides). The COs are responsible (with input from the relevant regional risk topics experts) for summarizing this information. They are encouraged to prepare critical questions to be asked at the management workshop. The CEO is responsible for the CRA results and emphasizes this responsibility by issuing invitations to the CRA workshop. The management workshop is the core activity in the process. During the workshop, management discusses, identifies and analyzes the compliance risks for the entity. Decisions are taken regarding the importance and priority of the risks and the corresponding mitigation measures. The responsible CO consults with the CEO based on the discussion with the relevant risk regional experts, to decide who should participate in the CRA management workshop and whether one or more CRA workshops (split by Regions, Business Units or functions) need to be held. The agreed dates should be communicated to LC CO RFC RC. A certified public accountant (such as Ernst & Young) has the right to participate in the management CRA workshop. The meeting invitation to the management workshop is sent by the CEO, or the CEO and the responsible CO jointly. It is highly recommended that the CRA workshop is held prior to the entity's ERM workshop. Consider that the time assigned for the workshop should allow enough time for deep discussions and measures description. The already identified hypotheses and risks during the preparation phase shall be discussed and agreed with management during this workshop. in order to identify potential new compliance risks a creative brainstorming session shall be conducted in the workshop to encourage participants to think outside the box. Without this brainstorming session it might happen that only known risks and patterns are identified but new arising topics might be overlooked or are identified too late. The risks identified are prioritized to obtain a rating of all risks. The rating order is from Top 1 (the most critical risks, the most important risks for the entity and the risks that most urgently require mitigation measures to be defined and implemented) to Top 5. All risks defined in the CRA management workshop must be classified for Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) ad-hoc reporting relevancy, based on management judgment. Relevant risks must subsequently be treated according to the ERM process and assessed with the ERM methodology. Finally, a response plan for all risks must be created with the following information: - Risk description: there is a risk that…, which may lead to… - Measure - Risk Owner - Relevant for ERM reporting (Y/N) - Transferred from last CRA (Y/N) - Priority (Level 1-5) Note that an existing compliance case cannot be reported as a risk within the CRA process because, in logical terms, this risk has already materialized. HR relevant risks are not to be reported in the CRA workshop, contact HR department to address them accordingly. The results of the CRA workshops and the local monitoring of response plans were formerly reported in Excel, without the possibility of a central evaluation in a timely manner.

{"text": "reporting and allows local tool-based monitoring of response plans implementation as well as central analysis. As an additional function, notification e-mails have been configured to alert people in charge of implementation, informing them about newly created response plans and the reaching of deadlines. The new tool is available as of now (CRA2018) for the Top-Risk Countries 2018 and must be used starting from CRA2020 for the CRA Entities and CRA Regions. Identified compliance risks and their corresponding mitigation measures have to be entered in the CRA tracking tool accessible here: https://revweb.siemens.net/ams/index.cfm?go=app.welcome PKI login. The responsible Compliance Officers of the CRA Entities and CRA Regions are currently registered as users. For further access rights please contact LC CO RFC RC The implementation of the mitigation measures must be documented promptly in the CRA tracking tool to enable local and central tracking. The MoM of the CRA workshop should be sent via email to the Risk Management and Mitigation department (LC CO RFC RC) as evidence for CCP controls and EY. The responsible CO reviews the management workshop results, ensuring that the underlying risk description and mitigation measures are understandable. Then he informs the relevant risk owner of his assignment. The CO works with the risk owner to implement appropriate mitigation measures. ERM is designed to manage risk rather than eliminate it completely, and to provide a degree of assurance covering all business objectives of Siemens. CRA complements the ERM process to broaden the identification of potential compliance risks, and thus serves as a qualified ERM input. The following figure provides an overview of the process step Report to ERM. CRA ERM - Internal compliance risk assessment process - Focuses purely on compliance risks, ranked by prioritization - No central status reporting of mitigation measures - Entity is responsible for timely risk mitigation - Basis for internal compliance risk analysis - Enterprise risk management system - Broad focus on strategic, operational, compliance and financial perspective - Quarterly reporting to Corporate RIC Board - Entity is responsible for timely mitigating risks - Basis for external disclosure of risks and opportunities for SAG The CRA provides a structured and harmonized approach to prepare a qualified annual ERM workshop. The CRA serves as a filter to ERM. Not all compliance risks will be reported to ERM (based upon management judgment). When applying management judgment, it is recommended that the impact on the overall business objectives of an entity be considered, represented by the ERM impact dimensions. Option 1: One compliance risk entered in the CRA equals one risk in ERM. Option 2: Several compliance risks entered in the CRA are combined to form one risk in ERM. Option 3: The compliance risk entered in the CRA is of no relevance to ERM. The responsible CO reviews the management workshop results (with input from the relevant Regional Antitrust Experts on antitrust/AREA aspects), ensuring that the underlying risk description and mitigation measures are understandable. Then he informs the relevant risk owner of his assignment. The CO works with the risk owner and with the Regional Antitrust Expert regarding identified antitrust risks to implement appropriate mitigation measures. Once the defined response plan has been approved by the CEO and entered in the CRA tracking tool, the mitigation measures need to be implemented, tracked in the tool and their status to be monitored regularly. The responsible CO informs the management at least bi-annually, for example in CRB, about the risk's status and the status of mitigation measures. Risks reported to ERM follow the ERM process as well as the entity's internal risk mitigation process. The final step is to transfer the results of the CRA to the AREs of the corresponding Entities. The following figure provides an overview of the process step Transfer to ARE. This is only required for Audit Category 1 and Category 2 Entities (for further details, see the Compliance ARE Master list). The responsible CO of the respective CRA Entity and CRA Region distributes the CRA Workshop results according to their area of responsibility or the assigned AREs respectively, by the end of Q1. Within the ARE, the CO and ARE Management can define and implement additional mitigation measures for the relevant risks of the ARE. The risks and the response plan status of the ARE risks must be monitored within the ARE. This does not impact the reporting and monitoring defined for CRA Entity and CRA Region.

{"text": "Siemens considers respect for human rights to be an integral part of our responsibility as a global business. For us, this responsibility is a core element of responsible business conduct and we are committed to ensuring respect for human rights within Siemens' sphere of influence. Our commitment to this principle is firmly anchored in the Siemens Business Conduct Guidelines which set out the fundamental principles and rules governing the way we act within our company and in relation to our partners and the general public. Accordingly, involvement of the company in any infringements of human rights or other adverse human rights impacts must be avoided. Compliance with applicable laws and regulations is essential but beyond that Siemens employees are expected to be aware of these issues, and both to avoid infringing on the human rights of others and to address adverse human rights impacts in activities and circumstances with which Siemens is involved. General principles of respecting human rights - Involvement of the company in any infringements of human rights or other adverse human rights impacts must be avoided. - Be in accordance with applicable laws and regulations. - Be aware of human rights issues beyond legal compliance. - Avoid infringing on the human rights of others and address adverse human rights impacts in activities and circumstances with which Siemens is involved. The following is intended to provide an overview of the Siemens human rights policy contained in the Siemens Business Conduct Guidelines (BCG). This also requires a brief outline of several important conventions and recommendations by international organizations which are endorsed by Siemens, and the principles of which are reflected in our Business Conduct Guidelines. Other existing company regulations – namely other Siemens circulars – and related governance are not affected by the content of this chapter. 1. The overall commitment of Siemens to respect human rights is contained in the BCG section B – We respect the personal dignity, privacy, and personal rights of each individual. – is elaborated further throughout the BCG, especially in section K. Siemens is committed to embracing and supporting, within its sphere of influence, the set of core values in the areas of human rights, labor standards, the environment, and anti-corruption included in the United Nations Global Compact (UNGC) as an integral part of its business strategy and operations. Siemens has been a participant in the Global Compact since 2003. Siemens considers the ten principles of the UNGC as binding for Siemens AG and its Affiliated Companies worldwide. Siemens accordingly requires its business units and employees to always act in accordance with the UNGC principles, including, without limitation: Principle 1: That business should support and respect the protection of internationally proclaimed human rights. Principle 2: That business should make sure that they are not complicit in human rights abuses. Principles 3 to 6: Which define fundamental responsibilities for businesses regarding labor. As set out in the BCG section K, Siemens also expects its employees, suppliers and business partners around the globe to recognize and apply the standards of certain international organizations as specified in the appendix. Respecting human rights is a key element of the integrity with which Siemens expects all employees to act. As stated in Siemens Circular No. 226: chapter 3, section 5, all Siemens employees are required to avoid any involvement of Siemens in any infringements of human rights or other adverse impacts on human rights. Moreover they are also expected: - to avoid causing or contributing to adverse human rights impacts through their or the company's own activities, and address such impacts when they occur, and - to seek to prevent or mitigate adverse human rights impacts that are directly linked to Siemens operations, products or services by the company's business relationships, even if Siemens has not contributed to those impacts. States have the duty to protect and maintain human rights (in particular through legislation and effective enforcement of the law). For this reason our corporate responsibility to respect human rights first of all requires compliance with the law. In addition, human rights due diligence should be undertaken – as per the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights (UNGP) understood as an ongoing process to identify, prevent and mitigate adverse human rights impacts which a company may cause or contribute to through its own activities or which may be directly linked to its products, operations or services by a business relationship and account for how they address these impacts. Thus human rights due diligence goes beyond a company's own operations and direct contractual partners it covers a company's entire value chain. Siemens supports the UNGP. They provide important guidance for the further operationalization of our company's responsibility to respect human rights. Human rights due diligence and related disclosure are increasingly required by legislation., affecting Siemens or", "metadata": "E. Human Rights-1"}
{"text": "parts of Siemens either directly or indirectly. Furthermore, several states have already published national action plans to disseminate and implement the UNGP, others are in the process of developing such plans or have committed to doing so. Respecting human rights is integrated into the Siemens Compliance System with its pillars Prevent, Detect and Respond – and is covered there, among others, as follows: - Human rights due diligence as a module of the assessment of compliance risks within the LoA process - Human rights risks as a mandatory element of the Compliance Risk Assessment (CRA) - Human rights as an optional topic of Compliance Review Boards (CRB)  if required, the Chief Compliance Officer reports on the topic of human rights to the Managing Board and the Compliance Committee of the Supervisory Board of Siemens AG within the CRB - Reporting and further handling of human rights-related incidents as compliance cases The Heads of CD SU and LC CO report to the Siemens Sustainability Board (SSB) on the topic of human rights if required. Since fiscal 2017, the company's annual Sustainability Information contains a separate chapter on human rights. Siemens will continue to improve the integration of human rights aspects into the Siemens global compliance system, and aims to improve support for Siemens employees in their daily work in this regard. Human rights due diligence constitutes a key component of the UN Guiding Principles – understood as the continuous process of identifying and addressing the human rights impact of a company across its operations and products, and throughout its supplier and business partner networks. In case Human Rights PDD is required for your project, you will be requested in the LoA tool to initiate it ('early warning in key data section and request in the human rights module of the Compliance Risk Evaluation). The following chapter contains all instructions and resources to guide project managers with the performance of the Human Rights Project Due Diligence (PDD). IMPORTANT: The Human Rights PDD does not substitute due diligences or similar procedures required for a project by applicable local law or other regulation or e.g. by export credit agencies or financing institutions. Related activities should be considered for the Human Rights PDD and vice versa in order to avoid redundant work and inconsistent results. The Human Rights PDD does not substitute or modify specific due diligences or other assessments or similar procedures required by internal regulation. The Human Rights PDD does neither constitute nor does it replace legal evaluation or advice. Please download and complete the initial questionnaire. - Please complete the initial questionnaire to the best of your knowledge. You are not expected to spend much time on clarifying details you do not know yet. Filling the initial questionnaire should not take more than a few minutes. - If you have any specific concerns about possible human rights issues related to the project, please also include them in the questionnaire. - The initial questionnaire form will be updated. Please make sure to always use the latest version by downloading it from the intranet or the Compliance Handbook. Please send the filled initial questionnaire to the Authorized Compliance Officer (ACO) for the project via email to initiate the Human Rights PDD. Please initiate the Human Rights PDD as early as possible as this will help avoiding or minimizing the risk of delays, especially in case of further clarification or determination of a mitigation plan. What's next? Compliance will assess the project for human rights risks. You could be asked for further details in some cases. This will usually just take a few days, and you will receive follow up information on the results and on further proceeding from the ACO. The assessment may have the following results: 1. No indications for specific human rights risks identified and no mitigation needed: See tab 'Completion'. 2. Specific human rights risk(s) cannot be excluded, further clarification required: See tab 'Clarification'. 3. Specific human rights risk(s) identified requiring mitigation: See tab 'Mitigation'. 4. Specific human rights risk(s) identified which could not be mitigated (will apply in exceptional cases only!): ACO will contact you prior to issuing the related statement to discuss further proceeding – usually further clarification will be performed if the assessment so far would result in the identification of risks that could not be mitigated. See tab 'Clarification. Assessment findings and results will be documented by the ACO. The ACO will inform you within a few days after receiving the initial questionnaire that further clarification is needed. You will be contacted by the ACO for further clarification in the following situations: - There are indications of specific human rights risk(s), but the completion of assessment requires further fact finding, usually to allow for an in depth evaluation of a specific issue. - The assessment performed", "metadata": "E.

{"text": "so far would result in the identification of specific human rights risks that could not be mitigated. Such assessment result – as a general rule – will be always based on the results of further clarification. - Specific human rights risk(s) have been identified which should be mitigated, but further clarification is needed or seems the best option for preparing the mitigation plan. The ACO will align clarification and further evaluation activities with you. There is no exhaustive list of clarification measures. Examples include (without being limited to) extended research, involvement of colleagues (internal experts), contacting customer, supplier, consortium partner or other third parties, obtaining information from local authorities, obtaining external experts' advice/evaluation or consultations on the ground. Clarification measures will always be aligned between PM and ACO individually, also to minimize risks of delays while at the same time ensuring required clarification. Sometimes clarifying facts and exploring mitigation possibilities should best go hand in hand (e.g. in case of a consultation with consortium partner about responding to risks in the area of the joint (end-)customer). Please participate in and support further clarification activities, especially if they require contacting the customer or other third parties or involving colleagues. This will play an important role for completing further clarification as fast as possible. Clarification or/and further evaluation activities will then be performed as agreed. What's next? Clarification will have one of the following results, you will be informed by the ACO accordingly together with instructions for further proceeding: 1. DD statement 'specific indications for human rights risks not confirmed and no mitigation needed: See tab 'Completion. 2. Specific human rights risk(s) confirmed requiring mitigation: See tab 'Mitigation. 3. DD statement 'specific human rights risk(s) confirmed which cannot be mitigated (will apply in exceptional cases only!): See chapter 5.5. Completion Clarification results will be documented by the ACO. As a result of a Human Rights Compliance Project Due Diligence (PDD), 'Recommendations' may be provided in case further clarification is required or if no specific indications of key human rights risks relevant for the project have been found (see also next chapter 'Mitigation'), but project structure and operational environment could lead to such risks especially during project execution. As PDDs are conducted rather early during the sales phase (i.e. prior to PM040) when specific human rights related risks might not yet possibly be confirmed, 'Recommendations' provide the means to address potential issues where mitigating measures are not required or adequate at that point in time. However, if at a later stage in the process such risks become more tangible, 'Recommendations' can be a basis for mitigating measures. 'Recommendations' provided by LC CO RFC LF as a result of a PDD should be considered and aligned by the ACO together with the APM of the respective project. Please see Chapter 6 'Toolbox' for an overview of possible 'Recommendations' / Mitigating Measures. If specific human rights risks have been identified or – in case of clarification – confirmed and require mitigation, the ACO will contact you for the mitigation plan. The ACO will propose possible mitigation measures for discussion with you. Please also think about what could be done to respond to the risk(s). Together with the ACO you then determine the mitigation plan including responsibilities and timelines. There is neither an exhaustive list of mitigation measures nor one 'standard' mitigation measure in response to a specific human rights risk, mainly due to the broad range of potential human rights issues and further project specific circumstances. Of course, there are best or proven practices which will have to be considered. The way Siemens could become involved with human rights issues is another decisive criterion for determining mitigation actions: - If Siemens could cause or contribute to human rights issues, mitigation means effective prevention. - If Siemens through its participation in the project could only be linked to issues caused or contributed to by third parties, mitigation means trying to influence these third parties to take the necessary steps – in other words: 'Do something reasonable in good faith to influence others to prevent or improve the situation.' Mitigation Activities Sometimes mitigation activities could also be performed jointly with other parties – such as consortium partners – which besides efficiency gains could also help to increase influence ('leverage') on other parties (see above). In many situations, established company processes and operational practices may offer opportunities for mitigation of human rights risks without major additional effort or adjustments. Some examples of mitigation measures (not exhaustive!): - Adding related provisions to a consortium, supplier or customer contract - Adding related provisions or at least language to a compliance/integrity pact already planned for other reasons) - Making the topic a permanent agenda item for project meetings, workshops or other meetings on project site - Including the topic in staff", "metadata": "E. Human Rights-3"}
{"text": "training sessions (also jointly performed with other parties) or proposing such training measures to third parties - Agreeing with SCM to initiate sustainability audit (before or during execution phase) e. g. for third party manpower provider or sub-contractor - Including the topic in site inspections or similar monitoring activities - Implementing grievance mechanisms at project site jointly with other parties involved Results of a previous consultation with consortium partner or another third party on (joint) mitigation measures should be considered here as well. Even if the Human Rights PDD does not result in the need for risk mitigation, the ACO may make some recommendations for increasing awareness of specific issues in the further sales or for the execution phase. Please see Chapter 6 'Toolbox' for an overview of possible Recommendations / Mitigating Measures. What's next? The agreed mitigation plan will be documented by the ACO. The ACO will provide you the agreed mitigation plan together with the DD statement (incl. DD results) and instructions for further proceeding. See chapter 5.5. Completion. For each DD you will receive a DD statement from the ACO – which concludes the DD if there are no updates, see below – together with instructions for next steps in the LoA tool. You will receive one of the following DD statements: 1. DD statement 'specific human rights risks not identified/not confirmed and no mitigation needed' 2. DD statement 'specific human rights risk(s) identified/confirmed requiring mitigation' together with DD results and agreed mitigation plan 3. DD statement 'specific human rights risk(s) confirmed which cannot be mitigated' together with DD results (will apply in exceptional cases only!) What's next? You may then complete the LoA CRE human rights module in the LoA tool by selecting the relevant confirmation (and entering mitigation plan details if applicable). - Please note in case of mitigation plan: If you complete the LoA CRE human rights module after starting the implementation of the mitigation plan, you may choose the 'green' confirmation. Otherwise you would have to select the 'yellow' confirmation. - For further details about the confirmations in the LoA CRE human rights module see the related explanations in the light bulbs in the LoA tool. Please file the DD statement provided by the ACO (if applicable incl. DD results and mitigation plan) in the project documentation. Update of DD needed? The facts assessed in the DD must still be valid (= not affected by relevant changes) when you are going to complete the LoA CRE human rights module. Examples for relevant changes include (without being limited to) new consortium partner or new major vendor or media reports on allegations of potential human rights violations against customer or another third party involved in the project or other relevant changes in the project set up or political developments. Relevant changes could also 'improve' DD results. Examples: - Confirmation of less or even no risk(s) - Reduction of scope of mitigation plan - Confirmation of risk(s) allowing for mitigation instead of risk(s) without mitigation possibility If you are aware of relevant change(s), the DD should be updated. Please contact the ACO, and provide the details of the change(s). Update of the DD follows the same process as the initial DD (with the exception of the initial questionnaire). In case of relevant changes, see tab 'Update' for details regarding handling of the LoA CRE human rights module confirmation. If you are aware of relevant change(s), the DD should be updated. Please contact the ACO, also providing the details of the relevant change(s). For examples of relevant changes see chapter 5.5. Completion. Update of the DD follows the same process as the initial DD (with the exception of the initial questionnaire which is not required again). To complete the LoA CRE human rights module in case of required update of the DD, there are the following ways to proceed: I. Postpone completing this module until the DD has been updated. - You may choose this way if the DD and status of mitigation (if applicable) would have justified selecting the 'green' or the 'yellow' confirmation in this module. - You will have to proceed this way if specific risks have been confirmed by the initial DD which cannot be mitigated. Perhaps the DD update will have a different result. II. In case of time pressure you may also select the 'yellow' confirmation in this module ('Human Rights PDD has not been completed so far') allowing you to complete the entire LoA CRE before the DD has been updated. - You may choose this way if you have already informed the ACO about the relevant changes and if there are no indications for risks which – if they were confirmed – could not be mitigated and if the initial DD and status of mitigation (if applicable) would have", "metadata": "E.

Please then postpone the confirmation until the DD has been updated (see above). The following table provides an overview of possible mitigating measures for potential Human Rights related risks in project business (as identified e.g. during a Human Rights Compliance project due diligence 'PDD'). Information on how to respond to Human Rights related incidents / observations is provided in Chapter'Response to incidents/observations'. Additionally, specific mitigating measures are provided for special topics as follows: - Disputed Territories, e.g. Palestinian territories (Gaza, West Bank or East Jerusalem), Golan Heights, Western Sahara, Crimea (Crimean Peninsula) - An Export Credit Agency, Multilateral Development Bank or Multilateral Finance Institution is involved in the project - Technical Nexus, i.e. the project is technically related to another project / facility (such as e.g. a sub-station is related to the power plant feeding the power grid) Purpose and target groups - The toolbox is intended to support Project Managers and other project team members as well as Compliance Officers involved in project business with responding to human rights challenges during project sales and project execution phases. - Response to human rights challenges covers the mitigation of identified human rights risks as well as other activities in consideration of potential human rights issues not being formally classified as human rights risk. - The toolbox also offers guidance on dealing with human rights related incidents or allegations. Priority for smart use of existing procedures - Project management at Siemens and other related procedures within the governance of support functions contain broad potential for use in response to human rights challenges. Therefore and to minimize additional complexity and operational burden for colleagues, priority is given to the use of these standard procedures also in the context of response to human rights challenges. - Measures beyond that have mostly not been included in this first version of the toolbox but will be added during the ongoing extension of the toolbox. Understanding the toolbox - Human rights issues are diverse, and the specific situations posing human rights risks are even more diverse by type of issue, contract structure, regional environment and many other factors. Also, for this reason the toolbox cannot provide an exhaustive enumeration of all possible measures. - Furthermore, many measures may be suitable to respond to various human rights challenges or issues – which may also be helpful in case there are more than just one topic to address. - Please also be aware that measures included in the toolbox are not described in a 'plug and play' mode in many situations they will have to be further detailed and adapted to the specific circumstances of the respective project. - Measures suggested in the toolbox may often be considered together with other measures. Experience shows that designing a set of orchestrated measures will usually allow for better outcomes. Boundaries - Please carefully observe other relevant procedures which might apply or be affected by any planned/intended measure and involve relevant function as required (e. g. EHS, GM SEC, HR, SCM and of course CO, esp. incidents of non-conformance (human rights violations) – This toolbox should always be understood and used that way. - When it comes to collaboration with external third parties, always make sure to comply with tender terms and conditions, contractual obligations and applicable laws – e. g. re. Antitrust. Support by LC CO RFC LF - Project Managers may always consult with the Authorized Compliance Officer for their project – regardless whether the project has been marked for compliance in project execution – on selection and customizing of measures in response to human rights issues. Furthermore, ACOs may always involve LC CO RFC LF for specific intended/planned measures. The Human Rights pages on the Compliance Intranet provide further information and external references. Regarding Project Business and the LoA Process, guidance for the performance of the Human Rights Project Due Diligence is provided This section includes suggested measures which might be chosen at any point in time during project sales as well as during project execution phases. This also applies to changes of the situation following to the performance of the human rights project due diligence or to the review of the compliance risk landscape for the project at PM 100. Overview / References Ongoing monitoring of public media may play an important role to become aware of potential human rights issues or related controversies or protest regarding a customer or end-customer project Siemens could become involved with via project business. Media monitoring may also help to become aware of actual human rights related incidents which might require specific response. - Media monitoring may be implemented in various ways , ranging from creating Google alerts to requesting the communications", "metadata": "E. Human Rights-5"}
{"text": "function of your entity to commission such monitoring to an external service provider. - Effective media monitoring requires – among other factors – that local language is covered and that a broad base of media sources is in scope, especially including local media without any exclusions. - Terms such as 'human rights' or similar expressions should not be included in the search terms, as they often will not occur in media reports. Instead it is suggested to use search terms taken from 'daily' language describing what may happen – e. g. 'protest' – in a way media would likely report these incidents. - For more important or specifically exposed ('critical') projects likely to generate broader media attention and coverage, in addition LC CO RFC LF may be asked to create such alerts within the database used for risk screening as part of human rights project due diligence (may be created for companies, governmental authorities or projects monitoring is performed in around 16 languages covering approx. 100.000 sources globally). Applicability - Media monitoring aiming at identifying potential human rights issues at an early stage should predominantly be considered in case of possible community or other public issues / potential controversies. Potential involvement of indigenous communities could also occur in such scenarios. - Expected resettlements or other material impacts on larger groups of rights holders on community levels should always raise the question whether to initiate media monitoring. - The key question to answer considering media monitoring is: Would the local or regional public care about related incidents? Besides the potential adverse impact, this could also depend on the overall context of dealing with the respective or comparable projects or the overall protection status of indigenous communities and their human rights. - Consider media monitoring in case of greenfield projects if human rights issues could possibly occur in planning stage – e. g. in the course of public license or permits proceedings. - Media monitoring could also be suitable for brownfield projects , e. g. if the existing customer site or another customer site or (similar) third party project in the respective area is exposed to allegations of human rights violations. - Beyond these potential issues, media monitoring should also be considered re. other issues such as labor related if repeatedly dealt with in the public or in media: Migrant work related issues in the Gulf States are a good example of that. - Media monitoring should predominantly be considered in case of potential reputational risk for Siemens , but also to support becoming aware of upcoming or actual issues at an early stage. Overview / References When addressing certain human rights related issues, the project roles and team structure as defined in the PM@Siemens Guide can be used in order to obtain expert knowledge and support on specific topics within the existing set-up for a specific project. Among others, the following project core team functions can be of particular value in regards to certain human rights related matters: - Site Manager (see also chapter 'Awareness of Site Manager') - Project Procurement Manager (see also chapters 'Training for suppliers / Sustainability Toolbox' and 'SCM Detection Modules / incident driven inspection') - EHS Manager in Projects ('EHSMiP', see also chapter 'EHS process within PM@Siemens) In addition to involving these functions individually, it is always advisable to communicate any known potential human rights risk for a specific project during the project kick-off meeting / PACT meeting (with the support of the ACO), so that the mentioned functions are being made aware at an early stage (see also chapter 'PACT Workshop / Kick-off Meeting'). Example The following was detected during the Human Rights Compliance Project Due Diligence (PDD) for a project as part of the LoA process: - The sub-contractor planned to be engaged as a major vendor by Siemens for civil works (in scope of Siemens as per customer contract) had a number of safety incidents in the recent past, all of which led to injured workers of the sub-contractor, and - The country risk rating for OHS in the project execution country is high. In this case, the EHSMiP and the Project Procurement Manager were involved to determine the most adequate measures towards this sub-contractor to avoid safety incidents in the Siemens project (e.g. in form of contractual stipulations requiring certain safety equipment to be provided to workers of the sub-contractor including proper instructions on its usage, unannounced inspections by Siemens during the project execution phase, etc.). Overview / References In exceptional cases – and when other measures listed in this toolbox are already exhausted and/or deemed insufficient to deal a with potential or actual issue at hand – it may be considered to conduct a project audit focusing on human rights related issues. This should always be discussed and aligned with LC", "metadata": "E. Human Rights-6"}

If issues are related to sub-contractors, please see also chapter 'SCM Detection Modules / incident driven inspections' as an alternative way to address them. Overview / References Especially in case of concerns of possible human rights violations which could be caused or contributed to by others such as customers or end-customers while Siemens would be involved with such adverse impacts the question arises how Siemens could execute existing – or try to build – leverage aiming to influence the behavior of such third parties to make them act responsibly, i.e. to avoid causing or contributing to human rights violations or to terminate actual violations which may have already occurred. - In several situations, potential human rights issues potentially relate to other than just human rights risks at the same time, such as potential protest by local communities which could impact access to project site, project execution timelines or staff security at the same time. - Please therefore consider addressing human rights issues indirectly by stating a legitimate contractual context/motivation such as project timelines/risk of disruption of project execution, security assessment issues etc. – there is no need to act as human rights activists/defenders to address such issues towards third parties. - Use of leverage may occur in a pro-active/preventive mode, but it could also be required in response to actual issues you may have observed or detected. - Use of leverage goes beyond execution of contractual or legal rights. Use of leverage may also be considered as an offer of support to a third party (and not via a sanctions approach). - Please also keep in mind that third parties will not always be against addressing such issues, they may often face similar challenges – so strive for trustful exchange and collaboration. - In many cases it will be quite difficult to use leverage in the project sales phase towards the customer. Tender proceeding terms and conditions as well as applicable laws will restrict the feasibility of such efforts. But as outlined above, to some extent such issues may be addressed implicitly , e.g. re. project timelines or customer's expectations re. timely completion of required license or permit proceedings as a prerequisite for the commencement of the respective project. - If this is considered being impossible at a certain point in time, there might be better opportunities later – or you might consider different tactics or other business relationships to address. Applicability - The use of leverage may be required towards contractual counterparts – such as consortium partners or sub-contractors, but also beyond , e. g. vs. end-customers or other state or non-state actors involved in a project. - Use of leverage may be considered regarding various possible human rights issues , ranging from community and indigenous community issues connected to relocation, resettlement or expropriation to all kinds of recruiting, employment or labor issues. As well issues potentially resulting from collaboration with state or private security forces may be addressed via leverage. Examples / Case Studies - Consortium partner : The consortium partner has civil and construction works in scope and will have to recruit a larger number of workers for the project, mainly from abroad. Potential human rights risks include migrant work, forced labor, human trafficking, child labor, also during collaboration with labor brokers themselves involving local recruiting agents in the sourcing countries. Leverage may be used by supporting the consortium partner with training of his recruiting staff, selection of labor brokers, checks during recruiting etc. - This example is also applicable for sub-contractors. - Customer : There are concerns re. the appropriate consultations with affected communities during an infrastructure project. There have been community protests re. similar projects in the region over the last years, partly resulting in violence and involvement of police and armed forces by the government. Let's assume that Siemens has established solid relationships with the public authorities handling the community consultations. What about offering to the customer to support him with his negotiations or contacts with the public authorities trying to influence them to execute consultations in a timely but at the same time correct manner which would help to avoid delays or even disruption of the project execution? Overview / References Request for information may serve to further clarify project details not known when the human rights project due diligence has been performed. Such requests may be directed to contractual counterparts – consortium partners, sub-contractors or customers – and to other third parties (e.g. end-customers or public authorities). - Submitting a request for information doesn't necessarily require formal entitlement e.g. by contracts or applicable laws. - Justified expectations of the other party regarding confidential handling of such", "metadata": "E.

{"text": "information should be respected to the extent possible. - In many cases requests for information should be considered prior to decision making about attempts to use leverage (though in some cases such a request may be understood as a first means of such leverage as well). Applicability Requests for information in general may relate to all kinds of possible human rights issues. - In case of ECA/MDB/IFI involvement on the part of other counterparts or third parties, requests for information may help to figure out to which extent required due diligence – e.g. as per the OECD Common Approaches in case of ECA involvement or according to the IFC Performance Standards or World Bank Safeguards – has already been performed and to obtain information on results. - Requesting information will be important for understanding base line of potential issue areas or to track performance of relevant procedures vs. defined standards/applicable regulation (= whether project specific standards are in line with international requirements/standards and defined project specific requirements have been/are duly implemented). Examples / Case Studies - Consortium partner : See example in previous section. Prior to offering support during recruiting, you could consider asking the potential sub-contractor to provide detailed information about the planned recruiting program covering training of staff, due diligence on labor brokers, but also for accommodation planning at project site. This example is also applicable for sub-contractors. - Customer : Ask the customer for further details re. technical nexus [see there] or further relevant details of end-customer operation or project. - Customer : There are concerns re. the appropriate consultations with affected communities during an infrastructure project. There have been community protests re. similar projects in the region over the last years, partly resulting in violence and involvement of police and armed forces by the government. Ask the customer about his evaluation of related risks and preventive measures undertaken or planned with that regard (please note: staff security and risk of disruption of project execution by blockades or strike could serve as argument why such clarification is asked for). Overview / References In case project specific integrity pacts to mitigate corruption risks are going to be concluded for a project, such pacts could also be used to address potential human rights risk at the same time. - This could especially be considered if an integrity pact is not just concluded for the project sales phase (e.g. tender procedure), but also or mainly for project execution phase. Beyond creating contractual liabilities for the parties concluding the pact, such agreements state practical obligations for all parties re. handling of certain matters or for joint preventive measures such as periodic risk workshops. Human rights issues or risks may be easily added hereto if found suitable. - Depending on the circumstances, human rights issues may be included or addressed in integrity pacts in a rather general way – e.g. just stating overall obligations to ensure respect of human rights – or they may be addressed specifically , e.g. by referring to certain community issues already foreseen or listing relevant kinds of labor related human rights issues, e.g. dealing with migrant workers, their recruiting, employment, working and/or accommodation conditions. This will usually require that the integrity pact will also cover the project execution phase, as labor related issue will rarely occur already or only during project sales phase. - Beyond supplementing integrity pacts to be concluded for other reasons, you may also consider integrity pacts solely for human rights issues in certain cases. Regarding relationships to direct contractual counterparts such as consortium partners or sub-contractors, potential safeguards or provisions should predominantly be included in the respective contractual agreements. - Please always involve the responsible Legal expert and LC CO RG CL for further advice and drafting of Integrity Pacts. Applicability Integrity pacts may be used to address various types of human rights issues if all involved parties have a stake in the issues to be covered by the intended agreement. Examples / Case Studies - Customer and end-customer : Addition of general requirement to ensure respect of human rights in a large infrastructure project to an integrity pact mainly concluded for ant-corruption purposes Overview / References Human rights related issues in the areas of labor and OHS can arise in the course of a project, especially if civil works are being performed in countries with high / extreme country risk ratings for the indicators 'Labor Rights and Protection' and 'OHS' (see also chapter 'Labor Issues and OHS'). For projects requiring a Human Rights Compliance Project Due Diligence (PDD), such circumstances will typically be identified during the risk screening. As the PM@Siemens Guideincludes a well-established EHS process, this existing process can be used in certain cases to address potential labor and OHS issues. This should always be discussed with the nominated EHS Manager", "metadata": "E. Human Rights-8"}

The PM@Siemens Guideincludes EHS already at PM020 ('Identify EHS requirements') and defines specific activities for each project milestone. Example In a project in a country with a high risk rating for 'Labor Rights and Protection' and 'OHS', Siemens is involved in the installation of equipment together with a local sub-contractor of Siemens, who is in addition also performing certain civil works, which are in Siemens' scope as per customer contract. During the Human Rights Compliance Project Due Diligence (PDD) before PM040 it was identified that the sub-contractor has had several safety incidents in other projects (i.e. non-Siemens projects) in the past. The matter was discussed by the PM and the ACO with the EHSMiP and the Country EHS Officer, and included in the EHS plan at PM100. Measures were e.g. the inclusion of EHS-related clauses in the contract with the sub-contractor, and site inspections by the Country EHS Officer (see also chapter 'Site visits / inspections'). The measures in this section should mainly be considered for project sales phase, but may also be feasible already during pre-sales and/or project execution phase (in case of relevant concerns or indications mainly). - Please note that human rights risks mostly occur during execution of (end-) customer project including related license permit proceedings, therefor usually there will be no mitigation need for Siemens during sales phase. Of course, certain measures may be suitable or recommended in sales phase already. Overview / References Human rights due diligence firstly relates to risks for rights holders, and not to risks to Siemens. However, involvement with human rights issues and especially human rights violations will often also pose risks to our company. - Certain projects may specifically pose reputational risk for Siemens. In such situations it is recommended to consider asking your communications function for a dedicated evaluation of reputational risk for Siemens which could be associated with the project. - Please note: The human rights project due diligence does not cover evaluation which requires specific communication expertise. - In some cases, further functions might have to be involved by the communications function such as e.g. GM GA (Government Affairs). Applicability Evaluation of reputational risk should be considered in case of planned community relocation or resettlements of larger group of rights holders, specific exposure may exist in case indigenous communities could become affected or in case similar projects in the region or country have already resulted in related controversies or even allegations against Siemens. - Such evaluation could also result in identifying the need to prepare for (further) public allegations (e. g. by preparing a holding statement), sometimes also involving the communications department at Lead Country, or in the development of a comprehensive communication strategy and tactics. - Please note that such communication measures will usually not mitigate risks to rights holders, but instead mainly risks for Siemens. - Upon request LC CO RFC LF may support such evaluation by check of databases for similar/comparable projects/cases or for NGOs already engaged/involved in relevant campaigns for similar projects (same/neighboring country/sector/type of project). Examples / Case Studies - Project in sales phase: supply of equipment for greenfield hydropower plant project in country in South America - Project in sales phase: supply and installation of equipment in copper mine of private sector customer massive community protest resulting in involvement of state security forces, some community protesters were killed massive NGO campaigning against customer and large multi-national companies involved in mining project a couple of years ago Overview / References In some cases, the knowledge, insights and perception of colleagues close to the project site will provide valuable additional information or support with the evaluation of potential human rights issues or their likelihood. - This may relate to public perception of a certain project (or similar ones) or to the reputation of a third party involved in the project or to experiences with the handling of license/permit proceedings by public authorities. - Expertise and insights of local colleagues may significantly help to evaluate desk top findings or data base hits of PDD. - Local colleagues are also capable of the local language. - Whom to involve: Consider involving the ACO, colleagues from respective division etc., further to be identified per topic (e. g. CC, SCM or EHS), also via local/country CO. Applicability Consultation with local colleagues is relevant mainly for HQ projects or cross border projects/projects to be executed (= project site located) in other than involved ARE country. - Such consultation should also be considered to obtain a clearer and more detailed picture of the attitude of local public/communities towards a planned project.

This – at least for human rights related clauses of the CoC – should be ensured anyhow regardless of the risk classification of the consortium contract regarding other compliance risk areas. - In such situations it sometimes may be enough to ensure that related standard provisions are duly included in the respective contractual agreements/documents. - Besides contract clauses, you might consider other options in addition. Examples: Document related discussions in MoM, agree on regular/periodic review/coverage of issue in regular on-site inspections or jour fixes (see also Chapter 'Site visits / inspections'). - In case of specific issues/risk exposure it may be considered appropriate to include more specific contractual obligations/clauses (see also next chapter). This will also apply re. contracts with customers following to tender procedure. Applicability Use of standard clauses will mainly be suitable to cover potential human rights issues if the respective contractual counterpart of Siemens has a certain proximity or direct relationship to such issues allowing him to ensure by his own actions to effectively mitigate human rights issues pro-actively. - This will usually relate to labor-related human rights issues for civil and construction works in scope of the counterpart. - This may also include further issues re. community impact , especially in case of turnkey projects, depending on the specific scope. Overview / References Supplementing or specifying standard clauses/provisions – including the introduction of additional contract topics into contracts with counterparts not based on Siemens standard contract clauses – should be considered if Siemens standard contracts / contract clauses may be insufficient to address specific human rights issues , also with the aim to explicitly address such issues in a contract (beyond its coverage in the more general contract provisions). - Non-standard contract clauses could also be required in case there will not be any contractual agreement between Siemens and such counterpart by default (e. g. end-customer, project consulting/managing company commissioned by customer/end-customer -> see also sec. Integrity Pacts). - Contract clauses should not be understood as the only means to address issues in contractual relationship  other options (to be considered in addition) include: Document related discussions in MoM or similar document, agree in contract on regular/periodic review/coverage of issue in regular on-site inspections planned or agreed on anyhow etc. [-> see also section site visits/inspections] Applicability - Non-standard contract clauses may be considered re. most potential human rights issues. - They may especially be used to focus attention of contracting parties on a specific issue or to introduce contractual obligations beyond applicable local laws or to agree on certain due diligence regarding third parties involved by a counterpart, such as labor brokers, or re. dealing with certain potential incidents beyond/besides the terms and conditions of licenses and permits. Examples / Case Studies - Supplementing standard contract clauses with sub-contractor or consortium partner (civil works in scope): e. g. working with labor brokers - Supplementing standard contract clauses with sub-contractor or consortium partner (civil works in scope): Agreed standards of worker accommodation of sub-contractor / consortium partner work force in labor camp (additional requirements beyond CoC and extension of Siemens audit rights) - Non-standard contracts, e. g. customer : Basic principles of selection of/collaboration with state or private security forces (maybe also re. relocation) – of course within realistic boundaries! Especially if the customer is in a similar overall position as Siemens, the customer could possibly share our concerns and could be willing to take up matter vs. the end-customer. Overview / References The Corporate Responsibility Self-Assessment by a supplier (CRSA) is standard process step in supplier qualification (see the SCM intranetfor details) - In case of specific indications of human rights risks you might consider suggesting to/agree with Project procurement function to add further requests for confirmation/information to this regular assessment process in order to ensure that potential suppliers/sub-contractors are made aware of such requirements (and related contractual requirements, see previous section) from the beginning.

Overview / References Making the PM Execution Phase aware of potential human rights risks which might occur in a project during execution phase constitutes a basic measure  most further measures will require it as prerequisite. - This will also help ensuring that the PM pays appropriate attention to any related observations or incidents and that the PM will take care of drawing the attention of other project team members to such potential issues. [see also next section on Site Manager] - Awareness of PM Execution Phase should usually be considered in conjunction with ongoing monitoring measures for relevant human rights issue areas. - If required, the PM should be provided with a briefing on relevant human rights issue areas (LC CO RFC LF may support with related information upon request). - Applicability This measure mainly applies in case of potential human rights risks without specific indications e. g. due to country context or project type/background or track record of counterparts. - In many cases the human rights project due diligence will have already identified some potential human rights issues which the PM should pay specific attention to. - It may occur that the focused awareness of PM may be enough as measure to ensure that attention is paid to such issues without e.g. the need for the ACO to additionally mark the project for compliance in project execution (considered next escalation level, see respective section below). - This measure may be considered a means to support preventive efforts for most potential human rights issues or at least help identifying specific indications of related actual human rights issues. This won't really work if human rights concerns mainly or solely refer to issues rooted in international humanitarian law which will not occur/disappear or change in any other way during project execution (which mainly could be the case when it comes to human rights issues re. so-called disputed territories. See -> related section below). Overview / References Situation and background are same as before. In case measure 1.6.3.1 is selected and there is a Site Manager for the project, it is recommended as a general rule to also choose this measure in addition. - This measure could be applied to field team lead/similar functions/roles and to entire project team likely being on site. Applicability - See section Awareness of PM Execution Phase above. - Awareness of Site Manager should mainly be considered in case of potential human rights issues likely becoming visible at project site during project execution. See examples below. - This measure should not be considered an effective measure for human rights issues where related action may have occurred early before Site Manager arrives at project site or if taking place at different location). Usually PM should then also make sure to become informed/involved in case of any relevant incident or related observation/indications. - PM Execution Phase should also consider requesting/agreeing with Site Manager to ensure ongoing monitoring during project execution to the extent feasible with a special focus on the potential human rights issues identified before. Examples / Case Studies - Observations of possible human rights issues re. working conditions of sub-contractor workforce such as OHS (e.g. inappropriate provision of drinking water) or working time (continuation of work despite hot temperatures and without provision of sun protection devices refusal to reschedule daily working time due to weather conditions which could also be required by local laws) - Employment related issues usually cannot be observed at project site, but Site Manager may become aware of such issues rather accidentally through complaints heard or received) for example: overtime work , withholding of IDs or questionable pay roll deductions for recruiting cost/fees workers complain/discuss among each other during work on project site - Observations or reports of community protest connected to protest around project site (not: inappropriate community involvement at an early stage of end-customer project) observations of questionable response by security forces to such protest using violence without evident justification Overview / References - As described in the chapter 'Compliance in project pre-sales, sales and execution', projects are identified and designated for 'Compliance in Project Execution' based on the relevant Compliance risks - The review of compliance the risk landscape at PM100 should include a comprehensive evaluation of the potential human rights issues identified (e.g. during the Human Rights Project Due Diligence (PDD) and determination of possible mitigation", "metadata": "E.

Applicability This measure may be applied to address, for example, the following risks: - In case of civil works performed by a subcontractor / consortium partner / other 3rd party without a contractual relationship to Siemens, to address e.g. issues related to labor & OHS - In case communities / indigenous people are affected , to address issues related to resettlement, pollution, etc. - In case security forces are involved - engaged by Siemens or a 3rd party - to address issues related to possible excessive violence - In case there were adverse findings related to involved 3rd parties during the Human Rights project due diligence (PDD), in order to address the issues detected earlier Examples / Case Studies During a Human Rights Compliance Project Due Diligence (PDD)performed as part of the LoA process, it was recommended to designate a project for 'Compliance in Project Execution' due to the fact that: - The customer will engage a subcontractor (company name not known at the time of the PDD, no contractual relationship to Siemens) to perform civil works, and the human rights country risk rating for the country of project execution for labor rights and protection is EXTREME (information provided by LC CO RFC LF as part of the PDD). Siemens could become involved with related adverse impacts even without causing or contributing to them through its participation in the project (linkage with the company's business operations through business relationships). - Siemens will work with private security forces (company name not known at the time of the PDD) regarding security of project site and accommodation facilities for project staff. The country of project execution is affected by armed conflict, human rights country risk ratings for arbitrary arrest and extrajudicial killings are EXTREME. Same applies to security forces related country risk rating. Especially in case (state or non-state) security forces will be hired that are involved in such conflict, there might be a risk of excessive use of violence (especially as security forces involved with project site security). Human rights issues could potentially result from abusive use of violence by security forces. As above, Siemens could become involved with related adverse impacts even without causing or contributing to them through its participation in the project. These risks were reviewed by the respective Compliance Officer together with the Project Manager at PM100 and the relevant project team members. As a result, the following measures were defined and were included in the PM@Siemens process for follow-up: - As the company names of the subcontractor of the customer and the security company were meanwhile known, a background check was performed on them. - It turned out that the subcontractor allegedly had previously issues with forced labor and OHS in similar projects in the country. It was decided that the PM together with the CO will address this in the next meeting with the customer in order to create awareness for this matter. It was agreed that the site manager does 'visual inspections' to detect related warning signs on an ongoing basis. - The due diligence did not turn out any adverse findings regarding the security company. However, it was decided to discuss the concerns with the contact person from the security company and - as the contract was being negotiated - to include additional contract clauses. Also here, it was agreed with the site manager to monitor the security company closely. Overview / References The Project Acceleration by Coaching and Teamwork (PACT) Workshop as defined in the PM@Siemens Guide helps project teams in the bidding and execution phase to organize their projects efficiently and bring the participating persons together more quickly. PACT Workshops are mandatory for A/B projects. For other projects, PACT Workshop can be conducted on a voluntary basis. If no (voluntary) PACT workshop is performed for a specific project, also the project kick-off meeting can be used as a platform / opportunity to address certain human rights related matters. The PACT workshop / project kick-off meeting can be of particular value for projects where a Human Rights Compliance Project Due Diligence (PDD)has been performed and recommendations / mitigation measures are defined. In such cases, the whole project team can be made aware of the potential issues / measures and details can be explained. It is recommended to invite the ACO of the project to address these matters.

Before the start of the Siemens scope of the project (including equipment delivery, installation, commissioning and field testing, as well as a separate service contract), the governmental customer relocated two small communities which lived and worked on the area of land now being used for the project. Even though the resettlement has been concluded, there are still protests against the project by local activists, as well as a pending court case related to allegations that the resettlement has not been done in line with the respective local laws and regulations, and that the compensation to the families previously owning the land was not adequate. Details of the issues and potential risks were identified during the Human Rights Compliance Project Due Diligence (PDD)prior to PM040. The PM invited the ACO to the PACT workshop and provided a timeslot where the ACO could explain the details of the issues to the project team, many of which will be on site on a daily basis. The ACO pointed out that Siemens could become involved with related adverse impacts even without causing or contributing to them (as Siemens was not involved in the relocations) just through its participation in the project (linkage with the company's business operations through business relationships). All team members were asked to notify the PM and the ACO in case they would make any related observations during their work on site, so that issues potentially affecting Siemens could be addressed as early as possible. Overview / References On site visits or inspections performed by Siemens potentially provide various benefits: As a preventive measure they will demonstrate to other parties involved that Siemens is paying substantial attention to the respective matters. Site visits/inspections at the same time may also help to detect actual human rights issues at the project site. - The overall recommendation is to mainly utilize inspections/site visits planned or scheduled anyhow and for other reasons also for human rights related purposes. - Accordingly, such activities should usually be performed by project staff being on/visiting project site anyhow. - This may be done either explicitly , e.g. as agreed with the other parties before or by making such issues standing items for the site visit/inspection agenda. But it could also be considered to cover human rights issues implicitly , i.e. by just paying attention to related activities at the project site during performance of a site inspection. - Discussion of findings could then as well be included in review or follow up meetings where the outcomes of previous site visits/inspections will be discussed or analyzed together with the determination of action items. - In case this might not be enough to address potential human rights risks appropriately, it could be considered in addition or instead to agree on dedicated inspection activities either on a regular or on a case by case basis. - For all such inspection activities it should be clarified in advance whether and for which specific matters further experts – either from the project team or from the Regional Company – should be involved. Examples include dedicated site visits e. g. by CO, Security Manager, OHS MiP, Project Procurement Manager. - In exceptional cases, the participation of external experts or public authorities could be considered or even required. This should be clarified in advance, also by involving the responsible Legal expert especially re. involvement of public authorities. - Involved colleagues should seek to familiarize themselves with relevant issues and possible danger/warning signs in advance (-> section on issues, see also section on awareness of Site Manager and on PACT). - See also section on audits. - Covering human rights issues implicitly in standard site visit/inspection procedures and/or by referring to other legitimate contractual context/motivation such as project timelines/risk of disruption of project execution, staff security issues etc. could be considered here as well under certain circumstances – as stated above, there is no need to act as human rights activists/defenders to address such issues. Applicability This measure mainly should be considered to address human rights topics suitable for obtaining clarification or observations at project site (i. e. mainly labor/working conditions incl. OHS, security and conflict/protest close to project site and related issues). This measure may also be chosen for clarifying observations/alleged human rights issues reported by others before The Code of Conduct for Siemens Suppliers and Business Partners defines Siemens sustainability standards and principles for Siemens Suppliers, who are obliged to comply with its provisions, several of which are related to human rights, e.g. - Respect for the basic human rights of employees - Prohibition of child labor - Health and safety of employees - Environmental protection However, in some cases there is a lack of knowledge", "metadata": "E.

As a standard concept, Siemens supports its suppliers e.g. through individual meetings and by providing information. In the context of suppliers / sub-contractors engaged for projects, knowledge / awareness / training may also include specific human rights related issues affecting the project at hand – in a similar way as these topics can be addressed to the Siemens project team (see chapter 'PACT Workshop / Kick-off Meeting').

In the context of human rights related matters in regards to suppliers / sub-contractors engaged for projects, the following modules may be considered: - Incident-Driven Inspections: In case of identified breaches to the Code of Conduct for Siemens suppliers, Incident Driven Inspections are initiated to minimize risks in the supply chain - External Sustainability Audits: Such audits are conducted by one of Siemens' external audit partners, and are used as control mechanisms for high-risk suppliers. Further information: - Sustainability in the Supply Chain Internet site - Corporate Responsibility Detection Modules Intranet site Please note that deployment of these detection modules due to human rights related issues should always be discussed beforehand with the ACO and – in any case – with the Project Procurement Function (activities are commissioned by SCM). Especially in case of activities based on an actual human rights / compliance related incident, the ACO must always be involved immediately. It may occur that such incidents could also constitute a compliance violation subject to a compliance investigation. Any activities regarding such an incident would then have to be closely aligned with LC CO RG CH in advance! Depending on the urgency and severity of the matter, it should be considered to staff inspection teams with employees of the local Siemens entity if possible. In case of site / staff security related matters, activities should be aligned with GM SECin advance (see also chapter 'GM SEC Project Security'). Similarly, the EHSMiP should be involved if matters are related to EHS. Please note that these detection modules are to be differentiated from CF A Audits (see chapter 'CF A Audits upon special request').

{"text": "or insufficient confidence and trust into such 'remote' procedures usually play a role here. For these and several other reasons, increasingly so-called operational or site-level grievance mechanisms have been implemented. This basically means to develop complaint mechanisms on or close to project sites/accommodation facilities in consideration of the aspects mentioned above targeting workers at project sites. Similarly, related mechanisms have been developed for members of the communities surrounding project sites – of course with different specifications. Such operational /site-based grievance mechanisms have proven their worth – for both detecting human rights violations allowing for appropriate handling and response, but also as a powerful contribution to the prevention of related adverse impacts. As the design and implementation of such mechanisms is quite complex and procedures for handling of incoming complaints need to be fully in line with contractual and legal requirements (not only based upon local laws!), besides the ACO always the responsible Legal expert and LC CO RG as well as LC CO RFC LF should be involved from the very beginning. See also section below on dealing with incidents. Applicability Operational / site level grievance mechanisms could or even should be considered in connection with larger customer or end-customer projects and with the project execution country having high or even extreme human rights risk, also specifically re. the relevant issues and/or in case there are specific indications of heightened risk of likelihood of related adverse impacts, - especially in case Siemens could become involved with labor-related human rights issues via a consortium partner for or sub-contracting of civil or construction works, and where our external partner will likely have to recruit and employ a larger group of workers, possible to be sourced from abroad (which could create/increase risks also re. human trafficking, child labor or other issues re. migrant work) or - g. in case of a turn key project potentially involving Siemens with land acquisition/use issues such as expropriation, resettlements even if Siemens would not be directly participating in the related proceedings. Specific measures are available for special human rights related topics, e.g. if the project site is located in a disputed territories (e.g. Gaza, West Bank or East Jerusalem, Golan Heights, Western Sahara, Crimea), involvement of an Export Credit Agency / Multilateral Development Bank / Multilateral Finance Institution in the project, or if there is a technical nexus to another project / facility with potential or actual human rights issues. Overview / References Certain territories are subject to dispute among the international community re. the legitimacy of state control executed over these territories. These disputes touch upon mostly complex questions and issues in the areas of politics and international law. Involvement in a customer or end-customer project affecting such disputed territory as a rule will result in various issues re. international humanitarian law, significant potential reputational risk for Siemens at the same time potentially putting Siemens into a dilemma considering existing or expected future customer relationships. This situation may even occur if the project site is not or not entirely located in such disputed territory or in case the project has only a seemingly indirect nexus with such territory. In many instances, such nexus is far out of Siemens scope or Siemens control (such as e.g. the question of the use of electrical energy generated by a Siemens project). There is no recommended standard measure in response to such a situation. It is crucial to involve the responsible Legal expert. Please also involve LC CO RFC LF. Most likely such projects will have to be carefully assessed legally and from the human rights perspective. Applicability Relevant territories are - Gaza, West Bank or East Jerusalem, or to Golan Heights - Western Sahara - Crimea The fact that an Export Credit Agency, Multilateral Development Bank or Multilateral Finance Institution is involved in a project does by itself not alter / increase the inherent human rights related risks of that project. However, such institutions often stipulate human rights related due diligence requirements for projects they are supporting. These requirements are sometimes passed on by the customer to its suppliers (e.g. Siemens) as part of the tender documents / contract. However, they should be known to Siemens anyhow in all cases to avoid, for example, becoming a target of potential sanctions by the respective institution. Please be aware that this could also apply if Siemens itself is not directly involved in funding / financing transaction and related application / negotiation procedures. For these reasons, also the PM@Siemens LoA Tool displays a warning message under the Project Key Data tab: - 'For all projects with involvement of the World Bank, or any other Multilateral Development Bank or Multilateral Financial Institution: Advice of the respective Legal department is to be obtained to ensure that all relevant regulations are known and adhered to", "metadata": "E. Human Rights-15"}

Any human rights related requirements of an involved institution should be considered in the review of the compliance risk landscape as part of compliance in project execution (which is a recommended measure for such projects in most of the cases) or at an earlier stage. The following are examples for requirements by specific institutions: - ECA Euler Hermes: OECD Common Approaches - World Bank Group: WB Group Safeguardsand IFC Performance Standards A Siemens project might be technically connected to one or more other projects or facilities that have potential or actual human rights issues. When evaluating the human rights related risks of such a Siemens project, this has to be considered independent of whether or not the Siemens project itself is directly exposed to human rights issues – and it is also independent of who owns or operates the projects / facilities with issues. For example, a Siemens transmission project (e.g. delivery and installation of sub-stations) is technically connected to one or more power plants (e.g. hydro power plants or coal fired power plants that generate electrical power which goes into the transmission project) which have significant exposure to human rights issues. For projects requiring a Human Rights Compliance Project Due Diligence (PDD), such circumstances will typically be identified during the risk screening. It is important to understand that such a technical nexus could involve Siemens with related adverse impacts even without causing or contributing to them, i.e. just through its participation in the project (linkage with the company's business operations through business relationships). Accordingly, the human rights related risks of the related or connected projects / facilities must generally be considered when evaluating the overall human rights risk of the Siemens project. Referring to the example above, these risks must also be considered in case Siemens has never had any project directly related to the power plants in question, and also if the customer / end-customers of the Siemens project is different from the owner / operator of the power plants. Please note that a comprehensive understanding of the entire (customer / end-customer) project including all associated facilities (e.g. newly built access roads) is crucial for obtaining a reliable and complete picture and understanding of possible human rights related risks. A human rights risk assessment should never be limited to the Siemens scope of a project only or, limited by judging what could be within Siemens responsibility in respect to human rights – this is another, subsequent question. This approach for human rights risk assessments applies to all aspects of Siemens projects, e.g. the (technical) project scope, to the site location and proximity to the facility having issues, as well as to the time frame (e. g. if a service project is done for a facility that is already in operation and, for example, issues regarding construction of that customer project occurred in the past). All observations/reported allegations/complaints should be dealt with carefully involve CO (regardless of compliance in project execution!) unless an issue may be resolved immediately, exhaustively, easily and on site! – Example: insufficient provision of drinking water at project site – or rescheduling of certain works due to weather conditions in line with applicable local law in alignment with all parties involved etc. For all other observations, reports on alleged human rights issues received, always the ACO should be involved immediately/in due course. ACOs will ensure that such reports will be dealt with in accordance with applicable law and company regulation. This section introduces the key human rights risk areas associated with Siemens project business. Accordingly, this section is not exhaustive. There are further human rights related risk areas which may be added to this section over time. If you have concerns regarding a human rights related risk not included in this section, please as the APM contact the ACO. ACOs may contact LC CO RFC LF for further advice and support. This sub-section focuses on those labor related human rights issues – including Occupational Health and Safety (OHS) – specifically exposing companies to human rights related risks in connection with project business and beyond their own operations and own workforce. This sub-section contains further information about issues listed below. The following labor issues are not covered to date: Discrimination in the Workplace, Freedom of Association and Collective Bargaining, Young Workers. Why do we focus on civil and construction work? Workers for civil and construction works are frequently recruited for the project on a temporary basis. Depending on the availability of workers around the project site(s) or in the project execution country, workers may be recruited far away from the project site or from abroad. These workers could be migrant workers,", "metadata": "E. Human Rights-16"}
{"text": "and many – if not most – workers recruited for civil and construction works have either low or any professional education, and the recruiting in their home countries will often be performed by recruiting agencies (labor brokers) some of which may force the workers to pay them recruitment fees in addition to the payments by their customers (future employers). Illiteracy is quite common among the workers which increases the risks of employment related human rights issues and as well e.g. for OHS. All these factors make such workers quite vulnerable for labor related human rights violation. In addition, national legislation in some countries creates further risks or even adverse impacts, such as the sponsorship system in some states in the Gulf region (which does not permit workers to leave the country without formal permission by their employer). The employment of children by state and non-state actors may violate international law. Violations of the prohibition of child labor impose obstacles for children to exercise their right to education, childhood, development, play and health by being economically exploited. Siemens can be directly implicated or can be deemed complicit in violations of the prohibition of child labor, particularly when operating in developing economies. Definition of the Issue Child labor is defined by the International Labor Organization's (ILO) Convention on the Minimum Age (No. 138) as employment that limits or damages the physical, mental, moral, social or psychological development of children. It sets the minimum age for work at 15. In some countries, an exception is made on grounds of the country's economic development, poverty or lack of educational resources and the minimum age for work is lowered to 14 years. The ILO Convention on Worst Forms of Child Labor (No. 182) prohibits hazardous work for persons below the age of 18. All children are also prohibited from working the same number of hours as adults and at night. Please note that as a general rule children below the age of 18 may not be employed for work at project sites, especially not for civil and construction work. In practice it will be difficult for recruiting staff e.g. of a consortium partner or sub-contractor to verify the correct age of job applicants , especially those of those from abroad. IDs or other documents stating the age of a job applicant may not always be relied upon (they may be falsified or just not stating the correct age for various other reasons – or these documents simply relate to another person than the job applicant). Related challenges are likely to increase further if many workers must be recruited by a rather small or mid-size company within a short period of time e.g. due to tough project timelines. Convention No. 182 also prohibits other worst forms of child labor such as slavery, trafficking, prostitution, etc. Despite strong protections in legal instruments, according to the ILO there are 168 million children working throughout the world, many full-time. Of these, more than half (85 million) are exposed to hazardous forms of child labor. Many children worldwide do not have access to basic primary education. Implications for business Governments have the primary duty to protect human rights, while companies have the responsibility to respect human rights. Effective access to remedies should be available to those whose human rights have been violated. Companies can be found or deemed to be complicit in human rights violations committed by others where they knowingly assist to or benefit from such violations. The standard for knowledge could be either an actual cognizance of the violation or what a company 'should have known' in the circumstances. Business can be directly implicated or can be deemed complicit in violations of the prohibition of child labor. Issues associated with child labor include denial of access to education, health risks and the restriction of the child's liberty. The types of challenges that business is likely to face in relation to this issue include: - Inadequate enforcement of labor laws by authorities - A legal minimum age that does not meet international standards - Inadequate age verification mechanisms - High time pressure for recruiting - Recruiting of workers from abroad - Insufficient due diligence prior to engagement of labor brokers / success fee agreements with such recruiting agencies - High levels of poverty requiring children to contribute to the household income (also in home countries of migrant workers) - Cultural or social acceptance of child labor ('common practices') Violations of the payment of decent wages through the practices of state and non-state actors limiting the right of a person to fair remuneration may expose Siemens to several operational, financial, legal and reputational risks.

Definition of the Issue The right to fair remuneration is enshrined in Article 7 of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR). Specifically, workers are entitled to fair wages and equal pay for work of equal value without discrimination. Remuneration must also be enough to provide workers with a decent living for themselves and their families. Numerous conventions from the ILO provide for more detailed provisions on fair remuneration laid down in the ICESCR. For example, ILO convention 131 prescribes that minimum wages should be established at a rate that is sufficient to cover, as a minimum, the cost of living and the needs of workers and their families. Despite strong legal protection provided in numerous instruments, the ILO's Global wage report 2014/15 suggests that there are still significant wage gaps between men and women, as well as between national and migrant workers.

Companies can be found or deemed to be complicit in human rights violations committed by others where they knowingly assist to or benefit from such violations. The standard for knowledge could be either an actual cognizance of the violation or what a company 'should have known' in the circumstances. Businesses operating in countries in which oversight mechanisms and safeguards against such conditions are inadequate also face risks associated with deteriorating industrial relations. These include potential disruptions to operations caused by strikes or sit-ins, low workforce morale (with implications for productivity and staff retention), as well as lawsuits. In this way, deteriorating industrial relations may prompt workers to resort to the practice of working-to-rule. The types of challenge that business is likely to face in relation to the payment of decent wages include: - National legislation governing minimum wages that does not meet international standards - Poor enforcement of domestic labor laws and inadequate implementation of international labor standards - Excessive demands on partners to reduce costs and to meet tight deadlines - Inadequate pay roll deductions for recruiting cost, accommodation or safety devices, overcharging for food supply - Indirect payment of wages (to labor brokers or other third party instead of directly to workers) - Lack of union representation, undermining the capacity of workers to bargain collectively for higher wages - Relaxed labor regulation within export processing zones. Violations of working time through the practices of state and non-state actors my limit the right of a person to decent working hours. Siemens may face several operational, financial, legal and reputational risks where these standards aren't met. Specific risks may arise from potential violations of working hours regulations project business on the part of suppliers, subcontractors or other businesses involved in the project. Definition of the Issue The right to decent working time is enshrined in Article 7 of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR). Specifically, workers are entitled to the right to rest, leisure, reasonable limitation of working hours and adequate holiday allowances with pay. These conditions are linked to basic human rights including the right to an adequate standard of living (including adequate food, clothing and housing), the right to physical and mental health and the right to life. Numerous ILO conventions provide for more detailed provisions on decent working hours laid down in the ICESCR. ILO convention 1 stipulates that generally working time should not exceed 48 hours per week, or eight hours a day, with at least one day off in every seven. ILO convention 30 states a working day cannot exceed ten hours. Furthermore, ILO convention 1 also states that where overtime work is allowed and required, the maximum number of additional hours must be fixed , and overtime must be compensated at a rate of no less than 25% above the normal rate of pay.

Further risk to business may occur in the course of the association with practices of the extraction of work or services from an individual under the menace of any penalty and without consent. Businesses face reputational and associated financial risks if allegations of complicity in the use of forced labor practices occur in its direct operations as well as in the supply chain. In addition, business can face legal and financial risks as a result of criminalization of forced and bonded labor practices under national legal systems. Definition of the Issue The prohibition of forced labor is enshrined in the International Bill of Human Rights, namely in Article 8 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) and stems from the prohibition of slavery as provided for in Article 4 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) and Article 8 ICCPR. Article 5 of the 1926 Slavery Convention prohibits forced labor. It also obliges states to progressively end the practice. However, where the practice still exists, workers must receive adequate compensation for their work. Slavery under the Slavery Convention is defined as the status or condition of a person over whom any or all of the powers attaching to the right of ownership are exercised. Where an individual is enslaved, he or she may be subject to forced labor because of slavery. The prohibition of forced labor forms part of the ILO Eight Core Conventions on Fundamental Human Rights, including ILO Convention No. 29 on Forced Labor (1930) and ILO Convention No. 105, on the Abolition of Forced Labor (1957). According to Article 2 of ILO Convention No. 29, forced labor is defined as all work or service which is exacted from any person under the menace of any penalty and for which the said person has not offered himself voluntarily. The menace of any penalty does not have to be physical punishment or constraint it can take other forms, such as the loss of rights or privileges. Forced labor can take a number of forms. It can be direct, for example by exacting work from an individual without remunerating him or her and without his or her consent. It can also be indirect, which includes bonded labor or indentured labor. According to Article 1 of the UN Supplementary Convention on the Abolition of Slavery, bonded labor or debt bondage means the status or condition arising from a pledge by a debtor of his personal services or of those of a person under his control as security for a debt, if the value of those services as reasonably assessed is not applied towards the liquidation of the debt or the length and nature of those services are not respectively limited and defined. It may also involve the use of physical force to prevent freedom of movement or the retention of identity documents, particularly where migrant or illegal workers are involved. The frequency of payment of wages should also be considered here (e.g. one-time payment at the end of employment period). In general, monthly payment of wages will be a uncritical solution. Other forms of forced labor include prison labor. Prison labor is the practice where detained individuals are forced to undertake certain labor projects or work for private enterprise for no or substandard compensation, which may include prisoners of conscience. The UN Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, especially Women and Children defines trafficking as the act of recruitment, transportation, transfer, harboring or receipt of persons by force, threat, coercion, abduction, fraud or deception for the purposes of exploitation (Article 3). Such exploitation includes forced labor, as well as forced sexual exploitation. In addition, the International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families (adopted by General Assembly resolution 45/158 of 18 December 1990) provides that no migrant be subject to forced labor. Often, where migrant workers are employed, employers hold identity papers or wages, creating a situation where workers cannot leave. In many", "metadata": "E. Human Rights-19"}
{"text": "instances, victims of trafficking are afraid of the consequences of approaching authorities due to their immigration status and/or threats and misinformation conveyed by the traffickers. The ILO estimates that 21 million people are victims of forced labor worldwide. Because forced labor is generally rooted in poverty, discrimination and cultural acceptance of the practice businesses are advised to assess socio-economic situation, such as levels of unemployment and job scarcity as motivating factors making individuals vulnerable to exploitation when operating in countries with a poor human rights record. Implications for business Governments have the primary duty to protect human rights, while companies have the responsibility to respect human rights. Effective access to remedies should be available to those whose human rights have been violated. Companies can be found or deemed to be complicit in human rights violations committed by others where they knowingly assist to or benefit from such violations. The standard for knowledge could be either an actual cognizance of the violation or what a company 'should have known' in the circumstances. Businesses face the risk of allegations of complicity in the use of forced labor. Most allegations arise in the context of companies being complicit in the use of such labor by suppliers, subcontractors and other partners. This may include complicity in practices of forced labor by recruitment agencies. For example, the most frequent accusations involve violations relating to indebtedness as a result of the high burden of recruitment fees or wage deductions for board and lodgings, where no adequate policies and monitoring systems exist. In addition, forced labor is criminalized under most countries' domestic laws (e.g. UK Modern Slavery Act). As a result, businesses should be aware of the forms and causes of forced labor, as well as how it might occur in different industries. The types of challenges that business is likely to face in relation to this issue include: - Economic processing zones which are often exempt from national labor laws, and often cannot be inspected by labor officials to detect labor abuses - Weak supply chain management significantly increases the risk of complicity of forced labor - Socio-economic causes, such as high unemployment and job scarcity as motivating factors making individuals vulnerable to exploitation - Embedded cultural practices may create an environment where forced labor is prevalent - Unethical and exploitative recruitment practices may increase the risk to business of becoming complicit in forced labor - Inadequate national enforcement of labor laws - Public corruption, especially within labor inspectorates and police forces, may be conducive to forced labor - Poor workforce health and productivity and ineffective workplace safety standards - A high prevalence and reliance on migrant labor may create an environment prone to forced labor. Specific risks will occur in case of labor migrants who entered a country for the explicit purpose of employment (foreign, non-national, regular or irregular migrants) either by allegations of complicity or direct involvement in violations of the rights of migrant workers, who might be characterized by a greater degree of vulnerability as compared to national workers with regards to the equality and non-discrimination in the workplace, freedom from forced labor, child labor and trafficking, occupational health and safety, working and living conditions (working time, wages), freedom of association and collective bargaining, access to remedies and other labor related social and civil rights. Definition of the Issue A migrant is a person who moves from one place to another to live (and usually work) either temporarily or permanently. The International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of their Families defines a migrant worker as a person who is to be engaged, is engaged or has been engaged in a remunerated activity in a State of which he or she is not a national. Estimates from the International Labor Organization (ILO) suggest that there are 150 million migrants in the global workforce. Migrant workers can be particularly susceptible to labor and human rights abuses. They are often unaware of the labor laws in force in their new country of residence, meaning that they are less likely to know when their labor and human rights are being infringed. Often migrant workers are unfamiliar with the native languages of the country in which they are living and working, which inhibits communication and access to potentially important information about their rights. Migrant workers are often faced with discrimination due to their status. Different forms of discriminatory treatment include low pay, long working hours and dangerous working environments. In many cases, employers are known to hold workers' identity cards, travel documents and other important personal papers in order to compel them to work for the employer involuntarily, restrict their ability to apply to other jobs, restrict their ability to move freely during non-working hours or to prevent them from", "metadata": "E.

{"text": "leaving the country. Migrant workers, who are likely to belong to a minority group within the country they are living and working in, are also vulnerable to exploitation and societal discrimination which translates into disadvantages in other areas based on their race, culture, religion or other characteristics. Additionally, migrant workers with an irregular immigration status are typically preferred by employers in the informal sector of economies (by definition being unregulated), exposing workers in this economic area to lower pay, less job security, and an increased level of occupational hazards. Despite the severity of these issues, weaknesses found within the national systems designed to ensure workers' rights are enforced typically result in abuses not being reported, or properly addressed. Implications for business Governments have the primary duty to protect human rights, while companies have the responsibility to respect human rights. Effective access to remedies should be available to those whose human rights have been violated. Companies can be found or deemed to be complicit in human rights violations committed by others where they knowingly assist to or benefit from such violations. The standard for knowledge could be either an actual cognizance of the violation or what a company 'should have known' in the circumstances. Although migrant workers are vulnerable to exploitation in many situations, businesses are most likely to be associated with violations of their rights in their supply chains or other business relationships including consortia due to limited control over the employment practices of their partners. In countries where labor legislation and workplace cultures explicitly provide for preferential treatment and higher payment for national workers than for migrants, businesses are likely to face heightened risk and challenges. The types of challenges that business is likely to face in relation to this issue include: - Inadequate and restrictive provisions in and enforcement of domestic labor laws - Domestic legislation that is contrary to international standards and company policies - Violations of relevant internationally recognized labor rights in export processing zones and in certain sectors (e.g. domestic work) - Discrimination against and prohibition of unionization of migrant workers. Companies could become associated with or exposed to practices of slavery, servitude, trafficking in persons and forced labor by state and non-state actors within their supply chain or other business relationships. This topic is included in the web book as a separate issue despite overlaps to other issues such as human trafficking because it is used by legislation and may also be frequently found in discourse. Definition of the Issue The term 'modern slavery' is not defined under international law. Rhetoric concerning slavery and enslavement is consistently intertwined with human trafficking and their concepts, along with many other exploitative practices, which are often collectively labelled as 'modern slavery' or some variation thereof. To allow for a clear distinction, modern slavery is understood as an umbrella term for slavery, servitude, trafficking in persons and forced or compulsory labor (hereinafter modern slavery).There are various definitions of slavery, servitude, forced or compulsory labor, and trafficking in persons, but reference is here made to the definitions made by institutions charged with addressing these issues, such as the UN and ILO. The prohibition of slavery is enshrined in Article 4 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) and Article 8 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR). Article 2 and 5 of the 1926 Slavery Convention prohibits the slave trade and forced labor. It also obliges states to end the practice progressively and as soon as possible. The prohibition of forced labor is enshrined in the International Bill of Human Rights, namely in Article 8 of the ICCPR, and stems from the prohibition of slavery. The ILO's Eight Core Conventions on Fundamental Human Rights, including ILO Convention No. 29 on Forced Labor (1930) and ILO Convention No.105 on the Abolition of Forced Labor (1957), also prohibit forced labor along with many other exploitative practices. In turn, the UN Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, is the first global legally binding instrument that prohibits the trade of human beings for the purpose of exploitation, and includes exploitation of the prostitution of others or other forms of sexual exploitation, forced labor or services, slavery or practices similar to slavery, [and] servitude. As a response to 'modern slavery' some states have introduced new legislation to address the problem. Such an example is the UK Modern Slavery Act 2015 (which requires businesses with a global turnover in excess of £36m and trading in the UK to report on their actions to address slavery, servitude, forced or compulsory labor and human trafficking each financial year).

Businesses face the risk of allegations of complicity in the use of modern slavery. Most allegations arise in the context of companies being complicit in the use of modern slavery by suppliers, subcontractors and other partners. This may include complicity in practices of modern slavery by services sector used by many companies, recruitment agencies and processes or labor-intensive low skilled sectors with rapid turnover rates. For example, the most frequent accusations involve violations relating to indebtedness as a result of the high burden of recruitment fees or wage deductions for board and lodgings, where no adequate policies and monitoring systems exist. In other cases, poor and vulnerable individuals may fall into trafficking chains by deception and are then sold by criminal groups into forced labor or other forms of exploitation. In addition, modern slavery is criminalized under most countries' domestic laws (e.g. UK Modern Slavery Act). As a result, businesses should be aware of the forms and causes of modern slavery, as well as how it might occur in different industries. The types of challenges that business is likely to face in relation to this issue include: - Informal economies which often cannot be inspected by labor officials to detect labor abuses - Weak supply chain management significantly increases the risk of complicity in modern slavery - Socio-economic causes, such as high unemployment, poverty and job scarcity as motivating factors making individuals vulnerable to exploitation - Embedded cultural practices, such as discrimination against women, children, ethnic minorities or refugees, may create an environment where modern slavery is prevalent - Unethical and exploitative recruitment practices may increase the risk to business of becoming complicit in modern slavery - Inadequate national enforcement of labor laws - Public corruption, especially within labor inspectorates and police forces, may be conducive to modern slavery - A high prevalence and reliance on migrant labor or other vulnerable groups may create an environment prone to modern slavery. Companies like Siemens could become associated with violations of health and safety standards by state and non-state actors. In accordance with the OHS Convention No.155 of the International Labor Organization (ILO), health, for the purpose of this index, encompasses the physical and mental elements affecting health in the workplace. This includes risk associated from the potential existence of poor health and safety standards in global value chains. Specific risk exists re . sub-contractors or consortium partners having civil and construction works in scope which might even increase in case of recruiting of low or unskilled workers (often migrant workers not familiar with the local language at project site or the English language, illiteracy could pose risk in addition, if not duly considered in the design and implementation of preventive OHS programs). Violations of the right to safe and healthy working conditions include the failure to provide effective protective equipment where necessary as well as adequate OHS training to raise employees' awareness and to prevent injuries. Definition of the Issue The right to safe and healthy working conditions is enshrined in Article 7 of the Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR). Numerous conventions of ILO provide for more detailed provisions on the occupational health and safety conditions laid down in the ICESCR. Despite strong legal protection provided in numerous instruments, ILO estimates that 2.3 million people die annually from occupational accidents and diseases, while work-related accidents occur at a rate of 153 workers every 15 seconds. Indeed, in August 2004, ILO Director-General Guy Ryder stated that work claims more victims around the globe than war does. The cost of occupational accidents and diseases amounts to approximately 4% of the world's GDP. This reflects expenditure on sick pay, early retirement, accident compensation, elevated insurance premiums and replacing skilled workers. The associated reputational damage caused by a major accident can also be extremely costly for affected companies. In addition to compliance with adequate regulations, health and safety risks are affected by violations of other working conditions. For example, excessive working hours or unpaid sick leave can increase the risk of accidents through the presence of fatigued employees in the workplace. Such factors also increase the risk of health complaints leading to losses in productivity.

{"text": "assist to or benefit from such violations. The standard for knowledge could be either an actual cognizance of the violation or what a company 'should have known' in the circumstances. Although the state is responsible for the protection of the right to work in a safe and healthy environment by ensuring that the right is observed in practice, it is incumbent on companies to discharge their duties to respect this right by promoting a safe and healthy working environment in all their operations. Decent working conditions can also increase productivity, decrease absenteeism and turnover of labor. Businesses face operational and associated financial, legal and reputational risks where they fail to meet these standards, either in their own operations, or in those of their suppliers, subcontractors or partners. For example, businesses may be confronted with interruptions to production or government-mandated workplace closures, as well as costs associated with compensation claims and sick pay where excessive working hours and poor OHS standards result in occupational accidents, injuries and disease. Moreover, businesses operating in, or sourcing from, countries in which oversight mechanisms and safeguards against such conditions are inadequate or weak face heightened risks associated with deteriorating industrial relations. These include potential disruptions to operations caused by strikes or sit-ins, low workforce morale (with implications for productivity and staff retention), as well as lawsuits. The types of challenge that business is likely to face in relation to occupational health and safety include: - National legislation governing occupational health and safety that does not meet international standards - Poor enforcement of domestic labor laws and inadequate implementation of international labor standards - Excessive demands on suppliers to reduce costs and to meet tight deadlines - Sectors with high levels of latent health and safety risk (e.g. mining, heavy machinery, construction) - The extension of value chains into informal sectors, where occupational health and safety is not regulated by government institutions - Lack of union representation, undermining the capacity of workers to bargain collectively for improved working conditions - Relaxed regulation of working conditions, including health and safety standards within export processing zones. Companies may also be exposed to risk through the possible association with practices of state and non-state actors engaged in the illegal trade of human beings for the purpose of exploitation. This is a risk a company may face in any region of the world and at all stages of operation, supply and distribution. In view of the global extent of the phenomenon, no individual company can conclude that it is safe from the risk of complicity in human trafficking, whether by the nature of the sector in which it operates or the context in which it is established. Aside from the financial risks associated with any legal action taken against companies prosecuted for trafficking offences, alleged involvement in the crime may deter potential clients or prompt existing clients to cancel contracts. The long-term profitability and growth prospects of businesses may also be jeopardized by a diminished capacity to attract new business opportunities and partners. Companies may also be stripped of export licenses and denied access to international markets in response to allegations or convictions. Definition of the Issue The UN Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, the first global legally binding instrument, provides an internationally agreed definition of human trafficking. Under Article 3, trafficking in persons is defined as: the recruitment, transportation, transfer, harboring or receipt of persons, by means of the threat or use of force or other forms of coercion, of abduction, of fraud, of deception, of the abuse of power or of a position of vulnerability or of the giving or receiving of payments or benefits to achieve the consent of a person having control over another person, for the purpose of exploitation. Exploitation shall include, at a minimum, the exploitation of the prostitution of others or other forms of sexual exploitation, forced labor or services, slavery or practices similar to slavery, servitude or the removal of organs. Trafficking is commonly associated with sexual exploitation, especially of women and children , and according to a 2014 report by the UN Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) accounts for 53% of all recorded human trafficking cases. However, the trafficking for forced labor is also a serious issue. It accounts for 40% of cases, constituting the second most common form of trafficking, especially of illegal economic migrants. These estimates may not provide an accurate representation, however, given that instances of trafficking for forced labor go undetected and unreported more often than cases of trafficking for commercial sexual exploitation. Human trafficking gives rise to violations of a number of human rights, such as the right to liberty guaranteeing against arbitrary detention, the right to security of person, freedom of movement and freedom from torture and other cruel, inhuman", "metadata": "E.

Implications for business Governments have the primary duty to protect human rights, while companies have the responsibility to respect human rights. Effective access to remedies should be available to those whose human rights have been violated. Companies can be found or deemed to be complicit in human rights violations committed by others where they knowingly assist to or benefit from such violations. The standard for knowledge could be either an actual cognizance of the violation or what a company 'should have known' in the circumstances. Businesses face substantial legal risk when they fail to implement human rights due diligence to ensure that business operations and activities at all levels of the value chain do not contribute to human trafficking. Human trafficking is criminalized under most countries' domestic laws (e.g. UK Modern Slavery Act). Accordingly, risks posed to business by trafficking – whether they are directly involved or implicated through their chains of production or supply – include the violation of national legal requirements resulting in potential criminal or civil liability. It goes without saying that companies may be found complicit in trafficking for forced labor if they employ victims of trafficking. The risk of complicity is highly likely in case of complex value chains involving numerous suppliers, subcontractors and partners. Where individuals in companies provide hospitality to business partners that involve the provision of the services of trafficked sex workers, companies may be also seen assisting trafficking. The risk of involvement in human trafficking in connection with sexual exploitation will significantly increase of project sites being located in remote areas and requiring the temporary employment of larger numbers of workers. Likely prostitution will establish around the project site or the accommodation facilities which often goes together with human trafficking, forced labor or child labor in its worst forms (see related sub-sections). Brand and company reputation are also likely to suffer as a result of allegations of complicity in human trafficking. Aside from the financial risks associated with any legal action taken against companies prosecuted for trafficking offences, alleged involvement in the crime may deter potential clients or prompt existing clients to cancel contracts. The long-term profitability and growth prospects of businesses may also be jeopardized by a diminished capacity to attract new business opportunities and partners. Companies may also be stripped of export licenses and denied access to international markets in response to allegations or convictions. The types of challenges that business is likely to face in relation to this issue include: - Allegations of complicity in human trafficking - Complicity of state authorities in human trafficking - An absence of laws that prevent trafficking in persons or their poor enforcement - Low conviction rates for perpetrators of trafficking - Weak monitoring of recruitment practices (e.g. of migrant workers) in the supply chain - Poor enforcement of labor standards and local labor laws. Communities and/or its members may be adversely impacted by projects in manifold ways – ranging from relocation or other land use related activities to toxic emissions into the air or water or endangering their access to drinking water. Among the key issues repeatedly connected with projects especially around public infrastructure or larger scale projects in the private sector are land, property and housing. In connection with projects, state and non-state actors may adversely impact rights holders in the enjoyment of the right to immovable property, including land and housing. There are different ways in which state and non-state actors can contribute to violation of property, land and housing rights of individuals. For instance, businesses depending on natural resources such as land have the potential to destabilize the environment because they can increase demand for the resource that may already be in short supply and which is crucial for local communities' livelihoods or the survival of indigenous peoples. In a post-conflict environment the lack of an effective property and land restitution process for displaced persons and ethnic community members, as well as outstanding claims on damaged and illegally occupied properties, mean that businesses securing plots of land or other immovable property for their operations are at risk of contributing to existing property disputes. In addition, the allocation of land and other immovable property by the state for different business projects may disproportionately affect the land, housing and property rights of certain groups and can cause tension or fuel conflict.

{"text": "businesses (e.g. credit, real estate, labor, rental contracts, agriculture production), and it is almost impossible to separate it from natural resource management. The following elements of property, land and housing rights are covered : - Land rights (whether defined under statutory or under customary law) are the rights that individuals and groups hold with respect to land and related resources (e.g. minerals, pasture, water). Land tenure rules define the ways in which property rights to land are allocated, transferred, used, or managed in a particular society. - Property rights in the context of the index are associated with the 'immoveable' property. Property rights are a bundle of rights to use, control, and transfer assets, including land and houses. Property rights include the rights to own occupy, enjoy, and use to realize financial benefits and to access services in association with it. There is an intrinsic link between the right to property, the right to adequate housing and land rights. - Adequate housing is interpreted in a broad sense and is seen as the right to an adequate standard of living, to live somewhere in security, peace and dignity. While adequacy is determined in part by social, economic, cultural, climatic, ecological and other factors, it is possible to determine a consistent set of factors for the purposes of constructing this index. Housing is not adequate if its occupants do not have the following as a minimum: - Security of tenure : a degree of tenure security which guarantees legal protection against forced evictions, harassment and other threats. - Availability of services, materials, facilities and infrastructure : sustainable access to natural and common resources, safe drinking water, energy for cooking, heating and lighting, sanitation and washing facilities, means of food storage, refuse disposal, site drainage and emergency services. - Affordability : a level of living when basic needs are not threatened or compromised due to unreasonable rent levels or rent increases. - Habitability : adequate space to protect from cold, damp, heat, rain wind or other threats to health, structural hazards, and disease vectors. - Accessibility : full and sustainable access to adequate housing resources by disadvantaged groups as the elderly, children, the physically disabled, the terminally ill, and victims of conflicts. - Location : access to employment opportunities, health-care services, schools, childcare centers and other social facilities, or a location in a clean environment far from polluted or dangerous areas. - Cultural adequacy : respecting and taking into account the expression of cultural identity. The right to property, land and housing has been enshrined as a human right in international law – both conventional and customary – through universal and regional treaties and national constitutions. The right to property recognizes everyone's right to peacefully enjoy their property, be it composed of existing possessions or assets acquired by law or claims which raise a legitimate expectation of obtaining effective enjoyment. The right protects individual property, as well as communal property as in the case with some systems. Limitations of the right are permissible, provided that they respect the principle of legality and proportionality and that they are directed towards assuring or advancing the public or general interest. States have positive and negative obligations related to the right to property, land and housing. Property, land and housing is essential for the protection of human life and dignity of the right holder as it contributes to the realization of economic and social rights, including the right to food and to social security. For instance, the protection of security of tenure, in particular from forced evictions, is part of the right to property and this link requires little explanation. The link between land and food is also obvious as land is a means to realize the right to food. For instance, large-scale land acquisitions and leases may jeopardize the right to food. Property rights and its link with land and housing rights have been extensively defined in the international instruments and case-law. The right to property is enshrined in Article 17 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) and Articles 13, 18, 19, 29 and 30 of the International Convention relating to the Status of Refugees. Article 5 (v) of the 1965 International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination guarantees the right to own property alone or in association with others. Several other core human rights treaties, such as the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women, the International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families, the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and the ILO Convention No.169 concerning Indigenous and Tribal peoples recognize the rights of ownership and possession of the vulnerable groups over the land and property and guarantee effective protection of their", "metadata": "E.

{"text": "rights of ownership and possession of land, housing and property. Implications for business Governments have the primary duty to protect human rights, while companies have the responsibility to respect human rights. Effective access to remedies should be available to those whose human rights have been violated. Companies can be found or deemed to be complicit in human rights violations committed by others where they knowingly assist or benefit from such violations. The standard for knowledge could be either an actual cognizance of the violation or what a company 'should have known' in the circumstances. Businesses face the risk of allegations of complicity in the violation of property, land and housing rights. Allegations of direct responsibility can occur if the company itself arbitrarily interferes with the enjoyment of the right – e.g. forcibly evicts individuals from their property, land and houses for securing plots for their operations. However (and this is the more likely scenario for Siemens), allegations also arise in the context of companies being complicit in violations by suppliers, subcontractors and other partners such as customers or end-customers. For instance, businesses may be associated with violations of right to property, land and adequate housing if they knowingly assist or benefit from state expropriation done without legal basis or not in the public interest – e.g. serious human rights violations associated with forced evictions, including arrests, detentions and killings of people who resist government relocation efforts that are linked to the leasing of large plots of land for commercial agriculture businesses. On the other hand, businesses are also expected to respect property and adequate housing rights of individuals by protecting them from pollution and dangerous areas , scarcity of water resources caused by their operations, against expulsion from or destruction of their property, or delimitation and demarcation of the communal land of indigenous people during implementation of business projects, which, if not observed could amount to a violation of the right to property, land and adequate housing. Together with the states, businesses are expected to undertake positive measures to create an enabling environment to enjoy property rights. For example, in a country characterized by extreme inequalities in access to property, failure of the state to take corrective actions could represent a violation of the obligation to fulfil the right to property and consequently may increase the risk to businesses in association with those violations. Businesses should be aware of the types and causes of violations of right to land, property and adequate housing, as well as how it might occur in different industries and link with other social, economic and cultural rights. The types of challenges that business is likely to face in relation to this issue include: - Public corruption, especially within land management institutions and law enforcement personnel, may be conducive to violations of the right to land, property and adequate housing - Lost records of land titles as a result of conflicts leading to unclear status of lands - Unclear tenure rights because of a conflict between customary and statutory laws - Discriminatory property, land and housing laws, especially targeting women, indigenous peoples and migrants - Large scale leasing of land for various business projects associated with human rights violations. Obstacles indigenous communities within a country may face in exercising their traditional rights may pose significant risk to companies. These rights are the rights to land, territories and natural resources, the right to decide their own distinct identities and procedures of belonging, as well as to have their identities recognized, the rights to self-government and self-determination, including to be asked for their free, prior and informed consent in decisions that may affect them. Definition of the Issue The protection of the rights of indigenous peoples stems from the right to self-determination as enshrined in the International Bill of Human Rights, namely in Article 2 of the ICCPR, and the principle of non-discrimination. The rights of indigenous peoples are specifically protected in the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, the ILO Convention No. 169 on the Rights of Indigenous and Tribal Peoples in Independent Countries. There has been no singular definition of indigenous peoples adopted at the international level. Rather, self-identification has been deemed to be the key criterion. The prevailing view among various stakeholders working on indigenous issues is that a specific definition is not necessary to safeguard the recognition and protection of their rights. ILO Convention 169 on Indigenous and Tribal Persons uses the following language in describing the peoples it aims to protect: Peoples in independent countries who are regarded as indigenous on account of their descent from the populations which inhabited the country, or a geographical region to which the country belongs, at the time of conquest or colonization or the establishment of present state boundaries and who, irrespective of their legal", "metadata": "E.

{"text": "status, retain some or all of their own social, economic, cultural and political institutions. According to international human rights law, this assortment of rights is considered the minimum standard for the cultural survival of indigenous groups. Article 33 of the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (UNDRIP) refers to the right to decide their own identities and procedures of belonging. However, indigenous peoples are often not afforded the same rights as other groups , including property rights, cultural rights and the right to dispose of their land's wealth and resources. This can be largely due to discrimination by the authorities. Other obstacles faced by indigenous groups include a lack of access to basic services, as well as to legal assistance and remedies for human rights violations . Indigenous peoples and activists are also vulnerable to attack by groups with competing interests. Implications for business Governments have the primary duty to protect human rights, while companies have the responsibility to respect human rights. Effective access to remedies should be available to those whose human rights have been violated. Companies can be found or deemed to be complicit in human rights violations committed by others where they knowingly assist or benefit from such violations. The standard for knowledge could be either an actual cognizance of the violation or what a company 'should have known' in the circumstances. Extractive, construction and utility companies operating in areas with indigenous populations are at particular risk due to the magnitude of land use. Issues associated with appropriation of indigenous land include infringements on cultural and religious freedoms, such as denial of access to or destruction of religious sites, as well as restrictions on their ability to worship through ceremonial and traditional means that may be directly linked to their land. Business activities may also impose restrictions on the movement of indigenous peoples on or around their land, thus hindering their ability to ensure their livelihood through traditional activities such as hunting and fishing. Pollution and environmental destruction of indigenous habitats are other risks posed by company operations. The types of challenges that business is likely to face in relation to this issue include: - Absence of laws that protect indigenous groups or an implementation deficit of relevant laws - Discrimination by the authorities - Impact assessments that do not include consultation with indigenous groups and determination of their free, prior and informed consent to all decisions that might directly and indirectly affect them - Pollution and environmental destruction affecting the livelihoods of indigenous communities - Harassment and violence against indigenous activists based on their distinct identity State organized forced displacement of indigenous communities and expropriation of their lands. Complicity in human rights violations committed by public and/or private security forces poses another risk to companies. Violations of the human rights by security forces include arbitrary arrests and detentions, extrajudicial killings, enforced disappearances, and torture or other ill-treatment of individuals. Definition of the Issue The definition of 'security forces' includes, besides public security services and private security contractors, all officers of the law, whether appointed or elected, who exercise police functions, especially the powers of arrest or detention and armed forces (military), whether public or private. Public security providers include international armed forces (e.g. UN forces) national armed forces national security services (e.g. internal intelligence agencies) national and local paramilitary forces and local, citizen-based security groups (e.g. town guards, militias, self-defense groups). The role of public security forces is to provide effective protection to the civilian population against human rights violations, while acting within the law and under the control of the civil authority. Private security contractors are also used by companies at times for the protection of their assets and employees in high risk countries and regions. However, their duties are limited as compared to those of state security providers as they cannot exercise the power of administration of justice. For instance, where private security guards are allowed to apprehend those invading a company's property, they need to hand them over to police which is responsible for the enforcement of law applicable to such cases. In certain circumstances, security forces are allowed to use force in the course of their duties. However, in accordance with Basic Principles on the Use of Force and Firearms by Law Enforcement Officials, they may do so only when strictly necessary and to the extent required for the performance of their duty. Implications for business Governments have the primary duty to protect human rights, which entails ensuring that security forces do not commit human rights violations. Governments must ensure that in the training of their forces, a special attention is given to alternatives to the use of forces, including methods of mediation and negotiation, as well as alternatives to the use of firearms.

{"text": "is incumbent on companies to respect human rights and to therefore ensure that contracted security forces comply with international human rights law. In addition, effective access to remedies should be available to those whose human rights have been violated by security forces. Such remedies should be provided for at both the state and the corporate levels. Companies can be found or deemed to be complicit in human rights violations committed by others where they knowingly assist in or benefit from such violations. The standard for knowledge could be either an actual cognizance of the violation or what a company 'should have known' in the circumstances. Businesses are at risk of complicity if they employ state or private security forces that perpetrate violations, especially where prior training and monitoring of such forces is lacking. Companies operating in emerging economies are often faced with significant security challenges , particularly in countries rich in natural resources. Such challenges regularly arise in countries where security forces, paramilitaries and private security companies have a history of committing human rights violations. For example, challenges in relation to security forces could arise as a result of ongoing or past armed conflict, corruption, a lack of discipline among security personnel, or significant governance gaps. Companies have a clear interest in protecting their employees and assets while maintaining respect for human rights. However, there is a risk that companies employing, co-operating with, or benefiting from the protection of state or private security forces may become (knowingly or unknowingly) complicit in human rights violations. Accusations of complicity may intensify if violations appear to facilitate certain business activities. For example, such violations may include violent crackdowns on trade union activists or anti-business protesters. Private security contractors are sometimes hired to supplement or fulfil security needs in environments where state resources are lacking or weak, but their actions are often unregulated. In cases where security is supplemented in this way, companies may contribute to or reimburse the cost of such provisions. While this security is expected to be consistent with national laws, international human rights law and international humanitarian law, human rights violations may occur during the protection of company property and personnel. There are numerous examples of companies who have been held legally accountable for the actions of state or private security forces , whether employed directly by the company or otherwise. Even where allegations of complicity do not result in legal action, companies can still face a range of non-legal risks. These can be of a short-term nature (e.g. operational disruptions as a result of community unrest aimed at public security forces and/or the company) or of a long-term nature (e.g. sustained consumer campaigns that ultimately require a change in company strategy or policy with respect to the country in question). The types of challenges that business is likely to face in relation to this issue include: - Unstable investment climates in countries with histories of widespread human rights violations by security forces that often go unpunished - Inadequate training of security forces in protecting and respecting human rights - Low and unfair wages among security personnel - Corrupt practices among security personnel - Weak regulation of private security forces - Inadequate risk assessments, human rights impact assessments and broader human rights due diligence - Inadequate communication of company policy on security forces and human rights - Inadequate monitoring of or consultation with security forces. The human rights project due diligence may result in the confirmation of human rights risks requiring mitigation measures – already in project sales or in execution phase – or in indications of potential human rights risks usually together with recommendations for response. - Please note that human rights risks for a project will not be confirmed just based upon the country risk rated high or extreme for the respective issue in the project execution country. In general there must be further specific indications either concerning a third party involved in the project or the customer or end-customer project or for this project as such. In some cases such additional indications may also relate to similar projects in the country. - There is one exception to this general rule being projects connected to so-called disputed territories (see related section in this web book). - Adverse due diligence findings usually are based upon media reports and other publicly available sources covered by the external risk screening database and tool used for the PDD. Reports generated in this database and tool may include confirmed human rights violations – e.g. indictment of a company or its managers by court decision or cancellation of a permit by a state authority due to such issues.

If the existence of the AML Red Flag can be confirmed by the Compliance Officer, it is necessary to further clarify the circumstances (see next subchapter).

This clarification is needed to assess, whether the AML Red Flag-Situation that typically indicates a high AML risk also means that the concrete situation bears a high AML risk. The responsibility for collection and assessment depends on the fact if a German ARE (e.g. the legal entity Siemens AG itself or any of its German subsidiaries) is involved in the business case or transaction where the AML Red Flag has been identified. - No German ARE involved: Compliance Officer In all cases where no German ARE is involved, the Compliance Officer will assess whether the AML Red Flag-situation that typically indicates a high AML risk also means that the concrete situation bears a high AML risk. Therefore, it is necessary toassess the - plausibility of business activity - integrity of involved parties and legitimacy of source of funds Depending on the circumstances the clarification may require, in particular, but not limited to some or all of the following: - Internal information about the business relationship / case , e.g. an overview of the involved parties and the contractual and financial setup as well as business judgement about the economic and technical adequacy - Plausibility check of legal nature / source of funds of the Counterpart - name and registered business address of the Counterpart - the Counterparts ownership and control structure(s) to see whether an AML Red Flag is indicated in ORBIS (see chapter C.2.1.3.), e.g. because one of the individuals raises integrity concerns to see if there are any indications for illegitimate sources of the funds of the Counterparts or any of the persons identified is involved in illegitimate business. - German ARE involved: LC CO IR In all cases where a German ARE is", "metadata": "C.

For the reporting of the AML Red Flag-situation the Compliance Officer may use the suggested e-mail notification. The Business supports this by giving the necessary information. Also, third party information can be accessed e.g. via ORBIS. Generally, the AML risk evaluation refers to the Siemens Counterpart. In circumstances where Third Parties make payments to Siemens (transactions), the AML Due Diligence should be performed for those Third Parties. On the basis of the collected information, it can be assessed whether a high AML risk exists in the concrete situation. Therefore, it has to be assessed if a situation or conduct of the Counterpart is unusual compared to the standards in the relevant industry and no sufficiently plausible explanation exists based on currently available information. LC CO IR will support, upon request, with the assessment whether a high AML risk exists. To get support from LC CO IR the Compliance Officer may use the suggested e-mail notification. The relevant business relationship should - wherever possible - be suspended and no further transactions be performed until the clarification is finished and – if needed – further actions according to the next subchapter have been defined. If the assessment confirms a high AML risk or even leads to positive knowledge of AML infringements in the concrete situation, further actions have to be taken. - Check plausibility of business activity Besides information from the business, ORBIS information especially from the categories Financials, local registry documents Industry & activities as well as Geographic footprint might be helpful (fields marked with an orange frame on the screenshots below) - Check for ORBIS Flags ORBIS shows orange Flags in the overview category Key Information as well as relating to individuals and companies in the categories Beneficial Owners, Controlling shareholders, Current directors & managers as well as Ownership structure (fields marked with an green frame on the screenshots below).

{"text": "Siemens can act in the value chain as a purchaser, i.e. as a customer itself, or as a supplier (Chapter H.3.). In both constellations, Compliance related risks must be considered and minimized. This Chapter describes the measures for Siemens Procurement to minimize Compliance related risks, especially in sourcing and purchasing activities. Supply Chain Management (SCM) has a central meaning for Siemens and is a major contributing factor to the sustainable company success. In the corresponding processes, Siemens would also like to ensure that all involved employees and business partners comply with the applicable rules and regulations. We extend this responsibility to our suppliers, too, and strive to ensure and promote sustainability within our supply chain. Following procurement processes require the involvement of the Compliance organization: - the supplier registration - changes/deletions to our Code of Conductfor Siemens Suppliers and Third-Party Intermediaries - insufficient assessment/audit results of the Corporate Responsibility Detection Modules - Vendor Dashboard - P2P Process in order to support the business and purchasing departments directly in exercising its business responsibility. The incorporated compliance check in the supplier registration of SCM STAR/PEGA SMDM on global layer level consists of the Business Partner (BP) check and in case that an AML Red Flag occurs, of an Anti-Money-Laundering (AML) Due Diligence. In case that a newly registered supplier is acting as a Business Partner a BP Compliance Due Diligence has to be executed in the BPC Tool and the respective BP ID has to be entered therein. The Code of Conduct for Siemens Suppliers and Third Party Intermediaries (CoC) is based to a great extent on the principles of the UN Global Compact relating to human rights, labor standards, environmental protection and anticorruption initiatives. These principles are derived from the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work of the International Labor Organization (ILO) and the principles of the Rio Declaration on Environment and Development. Siemens expects all suppliers to demonstrate their commitment towards the standards and principles of the Code of Conduct for Siemens Suppliers and Third-Party Intermediaries. Suppliers can commit to the CoC in various ways: - via electronical submittal during supplier registration process in SCM STAR / PEGA or via signed Corporate Responsibility Declaration in written form. Both options have an unlimited validity. - via acceptance of the Corporate Responsibility Contract Clause, which has to be a mandatory element of all new and extended procurement contracts. This commitment is valid during the validity of the respective contract. For the definition of procurement contracts please see: Definition of relevant Procurement Contracts - via acceptance of Siemens' Conditions of Purchase in which the CoC has to be included by the local responsible procurement units. This commitment is valid only Purchase Order based. In case a supplier insists on changes/deletions to the Corporate Responsibility contract clause/declaration or to the Code of Conduct, exceptions can be granted according to the Escalation Process. The Compliance Officer is part of the approval process for exceptions according to the Escalation Process. CWM = Central Warning Message Corporate Responsibility Detection Modules Corporate Responsibility Detection Modules monitor the adherence with the requirements and principles of the CoC for Siemens Suppliers. Based on a Risk Based Approach the following Detection Modules exist: - Corporate Responsibility Self Assessment - Supplier Quality Audits - External Sustainability Audits - Incident Driven Inspections Supply Chain Management/Procurement will involve the responsible/operational Compliance Officer in case of insufficient assessment/audit results of the compliance requirements therein, based on the decision of Supply Chain Management/Procurement. Central Warning Message Process (CWM) In case of a massive breach of a CoC requirement and if supplier did not respond, refused or failed to correct measures in the expected time frame a Central Warning Message (CWM) process can be initiated. The CWM process ensures that appropriate measures will be defined to react regarding supplier's breaches of CoC. This may include a message to the local master data responsible to block the suppliers in the respective systems. SCM FE has possibilities to address the local responsible via individual message or via CAP Monitor of Corporate Master Data (CMD). If a CWM process is needed, please contact SCM FE to define appropriate measures. Please note: All Siemens employees and employees of affiliated companies should report suppliers' massive breach of CoC to SCM FE. Siemens places a high priority on the complete, worldwide transparency, effective execution and control of Supply Chain Management and Procurement processes to safeguard the company's business success and to protect it against associated compliance risks. In the spirit of the Siemens Ownership Culture each of us is responsible for adhering to Supply Chain Management and Procurement related circulars and policies in order to ensure compliance - company-wide. Supply Chain Management and Procurement activities are to be monitored on a regular basis. Based on", "metadata": "2. Compliance in Procurement-1"}
{"text": "defined criteria certain vendors will be identified for further analysis regarding their adhering to compliance requirements. The Vendor Dashboard is an IT-based application in that all vendor data of relevant ARE´s are uploaded and quarterly updated. Target of the SCM Vendor Dashboard is to proactively enable the local SCM organization by provision of these identified vendors to foster compliant P2P processes by analysis of systematic process deficiencies and detection of possible fraud cases. A close collaboration between Supply Chain Management/Procurement and the Compliance Organization thereby ensures an effective assessment approach and results. Role of local compliance organization: - Pre-alignment of Top supplier selection. Verify about already existing investigations/clarifications. - Support of transaction deep dive in case of possible fraud incidents. - Receive possible fraud cases or other violations of Siemens Circular 226 and drive further compliance internal investigation/clarification. - Approve final assessment conclusions e.g. in cross-functional P2P review board. More information is included in the Introduction and Assessment Guide. Siemens places a high priority on the complete worldwide transparency and effective control of the purchasing processes, in order to protect against the associated compliance risks. The rules applicable to the purchasing process, which are binding on the affected company entities, have been documented in the P2P Purchasing Control Framework. In order to protect against key compliance risks and to sustainably implement an internal control system in the P2P process, IT-supported, preventative and detective rules and controls have been instituted. - SCM Procurement Compendium The objective of the Supply Chain Management Procurement Compendium is to provide an insight into procurement key topics. It addresses procurement employees and interface partners - for example in projects or product development - as well as all interested Siemens' employees. The SCM Procurement Compendium - provides details about specific procurement topics and links to further information - presents an overview of the SCM functions and procurement levers - explains key principles, processes, methods, applications and services. Web Based Training Correct Purchasing In the Web based Training Correct Purchasing you will see how the involvement of the Supply Chain Management mitigates risks and how procurement creates value for our company. SCM employees or SCM cross-functional partners will get to know the principles of correct purchasing, the so-called mandatory elements, as the basis of compliant and successful procurement for Siemens and will learn how important it is to follow the rules of correct purchasing. - Siemens Circular No. 213 Procurement principles at Siemens are defined in the Siemens Circular No. 213. - SCM Functional Excellence - Procurement Standards The core objectives of the strategic procurement processes are to sustain the company's success by making a consistently high contribution to earnings from the purchasing of material and services, to assert high quality standards along the entire supply chain, to identify and exploit opportunities to create value through procurement competence, and to ensure compliance and sustainability. To ensure that these objectives can be achieved an efficient and effective Risk Management is obligatory. - Sustainability in the Siemens Supply Chain Brochure Sustainability in the Siemens Supply Chain Brochure supports you in your daily work internally with colleagues and externally with customers and stakeholders.It provides you a detailed, structured and coherent compilation of main SCM efforts in this regard. - Correct Purchasing at Siemens Do's and Don'ts and Training Deck Procurement and sourcing activities are highly exposed to compliance risks. In particular breaches of anticorruption and antitrust laws can not only damage Siemens but can also result in penalties against the individuals involved. The Do's and Don'ts contain key rules on behavior and thus serve as a guide. The Compliance organization provides initial training on the rules of conduct so that the managers of the units concerned can transfer the contents of the rules of conduct to their own organization. Training material is available for this purpose. - Code of Conduct Brochure The Code of Conduct brochure serves as a detailed guideline to Corporate Responsibility in the supply chain for all stakeholders, especially our suppliers, third party intermediaries and employees in Procurement, Quality, Compliance and Legal functions, with the focus on our expectations of and how we work together with our suppliers in order to ensure our activities are sustainable and responsible throughout the entire value chain. - Compliance Intranet > Procurement, Purchasing, Payments Date Author Major changes of binding content January 1, 2019 Marcus Schoderer, (LC CO GR CORP) First release through Compliance Handbook.

The summaries are designed to reflect the different aspects: the process, main messages for the conduct and to answer the most obvious practical questions. Chart 1: Process Overview Chart 2: Do's and Don't's - What is the difference between a Compliance Investigation and an audit? Investigation is the process of inquiring into a matter of possible individual misconduct through research, follow-up, study, or formal procedure of discovery, in order to establish the facts of this matter. Investigating means to examine a misconduct, crime, problem, statement, etc. in an objective and independent manner with either exculpatory or incriminatory results. Internal auditing is an independent, objective assurance and consulting activity with focus on an organization's operations. It helps an organization accomplish its objectives by offering a systematic, disciplined approach to evaluate and improve the effectiveness of risk management, control, and governance processes. - When is a Compliance Investigation conducted at Siemens? All Compliance Investigations at Siemens will be conducted following the receipt of allegations, which, after a thorough plausibility check by Compliance Regulatory and Investigation, will result in the authorization of a mandate, either by the Chief Counsel Compliance and the Chief Compliance Officer for high risk cases, or by the responsible Compliance Officer together with the responsible lawyer from Compliance Regulatory and Investigation for all other cases. - What is the objective of a Compliance Investigation? The objective of a Compliance Investigation is to establish the facts pertaining to an allegation of wrongdoing. - How can Siemens employees be assured that they will be treated fairly? On basis of Siemens Circular No. 226, all Compliance Investigations will be carried out according to an established process and free of any interference. Once the facts have been established a legal evaluation will be carried out and both are recorded in a report. Employees may also rely on the principles enumerated in the following question. - What are the four most important principles in Compliance Investigations? - The Investigation Team shall respect the principle of confidentiality in an investigation. - The Investigation Team shall respect both the spirit and the letter of the law within each jurisdiction where Siemens conducts business. - The Investigation Team shall respect all rights accorded to the individual by custom and law in upholding the presumption of innocence. - The Investigation Team shall protect the identity of persons reporting misconduct to the best extent possible. - Who will receive the investigation report? According to the given process, Compliance Investigations reports are addressed in high risk cases to the Chief Compliance Officer, in other cases to the respective Compliance Officer. Furthermore, a distribution list is recommended in the report following the need-to-know principle. - Will the subject of a Compliance Investigation be informed about the investigation results? Yes - if the investigation did not substantiate the allegation, the subject will receive an official clearance letter issued by Regulatory Compliance Legal. If the allegation is substantiated by the investigation, the subject will receive notice of a pending disciplinary hearing. However, the subject will not be provided with the investigation report.

{"text": "Outgoing and incoming payments can involve risks for Siemens, inter alia, from an anti-corruption or anti-money laundering perspective. The former Compliance High Risk Payment Process (not to be confused with Payment Alerts from Finavigate® - refer below) is discontinued effective 1st of October 2020. The abolishing of the process is possible as the existing processes from other Governance Owners adequately cover the requirements without the necessity for additional standard Compliance payments controls. Nevertheless, awareness of Outgoing / Incoming Payments is essential for a comprehensive Compliance risk identification, assessment and potential local mitigation. Therefore, in the event of elevated Compliance risks, local mitigating measures should still be implemented e.g. payment blocks for high risk third parties / transactions, monitoring of manual / non-ERP payment processes. In the following chapters, you will find an overview about the tasks of Corporate Compliance involvement as well as the obligations of Compliance Officers and their contribution in the main processes associated with payments. Corruption is covered by the Siemens Compliance System very prominently regarding benefits by Siemens (Chapter A.1.), Sponsoring, Donations and Memberships (Chapter A.2.) as well as Facilitation Payments (Chapter A.3.). Also, the Business Partner process (Chapter A.4.) relating to corruption via third parties is well known. Furthermore, CF F process Control Over Funds (CoF) (Siemens Circular 208 Treasury Transactions in the Company) and SOP SCM process Purchase-to Pay (P2P) (Siemens Circular 130 Compliance in the Purchasing Process – Purchase-to-Pay (P2P) Control Framework) also aim at the prevention of corruption. Corporate Compliance is involved in the following committees and processes as described in this Chapter as laid out below. - P2P Process Committee: The P2P Process Committee serves the alignment and close collaboration of the relevant corporate functions (i.e. SOP SCM, CF F (Treasury), CF R (Accounting), LC CO, CF R/IC, CF A CA, SOP IT). LC CO is represented by LC CO RFC. The committee meets approx. three times per year and aligns inter alia the: - P2P alert criteria (see here under the tabs Preventative Controls and Detective Controls), - SCM Vendor Dashboard flags (Chapter 3 of the SCM Vendor Dash Board Assessment Guide), - CoF (Control Over Funds) / CoP (Central Routing of Payments) methods, and - discusses risk trends / emerging risks in relation to payments. - High Risk Payment Scoring Committee: The alert monitor of Finavigate® as part of the Control over Funds (CoF) process identifies critical payments based on defined alert criteria (e.g. High-Risk Payments, such as non-standard payments methods, e.g. cash, cheques and Suspicious Outgoing Payment). CF F (Treasury) and LC CO decide on the alert criteria at the annual High-Risk Payment Scoring Committee. LC CO is represented by LC CO RFC. - Central Compliance Monitoring by LC CO RFC Outgoing payment risks are part of LC CO RFC RC central monitoring activities. Key elements of central monitoring activities are an aggregated risk analysis based on the following information sources to identify and assess unusual transactions, contexts and developments over the course of time. - Alert Monitoring in Finavigate® - Finance Cockpit incl. non-preferred payment methods, such as - Non-ERP-system based check payments - Other manual outgoing payments - Direct debit by third parties - Cash withdrawals and transfers - P2P Control Framework - SCM Vendor Dashboard Further details about these measures as well as central monitoring activities will be implemented in Chapter K.1 on Compliance Risk Assessment. Operational Compliance Officers are involved in the following processes: P2P - Continuous Control Monitoring Alert (CCM), SCM Vendor Dashboard and Payment Alerts from Finavigate® (CF F / HoA). CCM alerts are flagged by local Supply Chain Management as Key Alert following evaluation when a deliberate or fraudulent rule breach is suspected. These Key Alerts are required to be evaluated by the responsible CCM Local Monitoring which is generally the responsible Compliance Officer to get a reasonable second review to decide, if the incident is confirmed or not. In order to address the identified compliance incidents, all Key Alerts closed with status Incident Confirmed will be addressed to further stakeholders, such as Management (e.g. CFO) and the responsible Compliance Officer to initiate an investigation as Compliance case according to the role of the CCM Local Monitoring, as described P2P Purchasing Role Model. It is recommended that a local P2P Control Board is established in order to ensure the structured and regular, at least quarterly coordination of relevant user functions (i.e. Supply Chain Management, Treasury, Accounting, Compliance Officer , R/IC, CF A) and the level of Siemens entities. The board analyzes patterns and developments for its entity also in comparison with other AREs. For the SCM Vendor Dashboard application (also see Chapter H.2.4.) SOP SCM bi-quarterly (Q2 and Q4) identifies suppliers for a detailed assessment based on the defined red-flag criteria. The suppliers with the highest number of red-flags are selected", "metadata": "4. Outgoing and Incoming payments-1"}

The responsible Compliance Officer will be involved / contacted by SOP SCM according to Chapter 4.8 of the Vendor Dash Board Assessment Guide for the: - Pre-alignment of Top supplier selection - Verify about already existing investigations / clarifications - Support of transaction deep dive in case of possible fraud incidents - Receive possible fraud cases or other violations of Siemens Circular 226 and drive further compliance internal investigation / clarification - Approve final assessment conclusions e.g. in cross-functional P2P Control board Alerts of individual outgoing payments with higher risk characteristics are generated in alert monitor from Finavigate® on corporate level. If a Siemens entity is not able to use the alert monitor from Finavigate® for all outgoing payments an individual setup of local controls has to be defined and agreed by CF F CMP. - High Risk Payment / Suspicious Payment Alerts The responsible Head of Accounting (HoA) assess the Payment Alerts as generated by the Outgoing Payment Alerts monitor in Finavigate®. If the HoA doubts that the payment complies with legal requirements, has been correctly executed on basis of a legitimate liability and/or Siemens internal regulations, then the HoA should refer the payment to the local responsible Compliance Officer for further assessment. Payment Alerts can come form a) before final payment run execution in Finavigate® (known as Suspicious Payment ) and b) after final payment run execution in Finavigate® (known as High Risk Payment ) alerts. - Cash Alerts At the first level, the responsible HoA assess each detective post-payment Cash Alert generated by the Finavigate® Outgoing Payment alert monitor in order to check why the Cash Alert was generated and to ascertain, if it is reoccurring. In case of reoccurring Cash Alerts i.e. two or more Cash Alerts within one fiscal year, then the HoA has to assess the reason why Cash Alerts are recurringly generated and, in accordance with CF RIC PCMB 3.2.3.3-19, inform the responsible Compliance Officer appropriately. The Compliance Officer should assess whether additional risk mitigation measures, in alignment with the HoA, are necessary. From an Anti-Money Laundering (AML) perspective, we should be aware of incoming payments that would trigger an AML Red Flag (Chapter C.1.). Insofar, a respective application is in development to support German AREs regarding their specific local law requirements. - Siemens Circular 208 (Treasury Transactions in the Company) The circular (Treasury Guideline) establishes amongst other things detailed, binding objectives, principles and mainly central controls (Control over Funds (CoF)) for bank accounts and payments (including cash payments). - Siemens Circular No. 130 (Compliance in the Purchasing Process – Purchase-to-Pay (P2P) Control Framework) The Purchase-to-Pay (P2P) Control Framework is a company-wide rule set comprising compliance-related controls for the purchasing process, along with the corresponding regulations, remediation measures and obligatory procedures to be instituted throughout the company.

{"text": "The overall governance for the handling of compliance cases at Siemens is with Compliance Regulatory: - Compliance Regulatory is responsible for investigating compliance cases where required and for taking actions including disciplinary and remediation measures when chargeable violations by Siemens employees are identified. - There is no differentiation between local and central cases. - All cases are being classified following a risk based approach as low, medium, and high risk cases this classification is being done from a corporate view in the meaning that high risk cases can have a big impact on the global Siemens company, medium risk cases usually have an impact on the involved business unit and / or the country only, and low risk cases have no immediate risk for the company (but still could turn out to be medium or high risk cases in course of the case development). Compliance cases concern in particular violations of criminal or administrative law and related internal regulations as well as criminal or administrative proceedings against the company or its employees. Therefore, each compliance case handled at Compliance Investigation & Regulatory has a designated lawyer from Compliance Investigation & Regulatory Central Function assigned to the case for its whole lifecycle. The lawyer is handling the case from the receipt of allegations, the plausibility check, the preparation of the mandate to be issued, the investigation together with the investigator, the remediation together with the remediation manager and labor lawyer, to the final legal aspects before closing the case. The lawyer is giving legal advice on all compliance related matters caused by the case. The legal advice from the team members of Investigation & Regulatory Central Function together with the fact finding activities from the Investigation & Regulatory Case Handling team as well as the specialized input from the Remediation & Discipline team safeguards company interests worldwide in major investigations by public prosecutors and other law enforcement authorities against Siemens AG, Siemens Regional Companies, affiliates and/or employees. In this context, the lawyers at Compliance Legal also handle information requests from authorities (in Germany and worldwide). The Compliance Investigation & Regulatory Remediation & Discipline team ensures proper response to the findings form investigations. It supports the business and tracks the implementation of recommendations included in the investigation reports in order to ensure that identified deficiencies are eliminated and has governance responsibility for the disciplinary process resulting from non-compliant behavior, including steering the (regular and accelerated) Central Disciplinary Process, Principles - If you become aware of a plausible allegation of a compliance case, e.g. of - a violation of criminal or administrative law or - a violation of a Siemens-internal regulation relating to criminal or administrative law (for example, the Business Conduct Guidelines) - use for reporting one of the following contacts - the Chief Compliance Officer, - the Compliance Officer responsible for the Division, Business Unit or country, - the Tell Us reporting channel or - the Siemens Ombudsman - or the colleagues from Compliance Investigation & Regulatory Central Function", "metadata": "0.

{"text": "Siemens expects its employees to comply with the law and Siemens' internal regulations, to behave in a law-abiding and exemplary manner in order to prevent compliance cases from arising and to immediately report all information they may have regarding impending or existing compliance cases. Siemens also expects its employees when affected to cooperate in internal compliance investigations in a transparent and open manner in order to enable Siemens to detect and to stop any potential misconduct. Siemens will react adequately to determined Compliance violations by asserting claims for damages and the implementation of disciplinary measures. However, considering all circumstances of the individual case, it may be in the best interests of the company to refrain from these actions against an employee who has committed a Compliance offense or who is suspected of such (Granting of Leniency). This is particularly the case if, - the company is dependent on the active participation of suspicious employees for the clarification of Compliance-relevant facts with serious material or immaterial effects, and if such participation can only be obtained in this way, and - the employee shows understanding and convincingly communicates that he will abstain from future misconduct and act as a role model for integrity. Details can be provided by LC CO IR RD The matters listed below are compliance cases if they involve actions that are performed by Siemens employees in the course of their business activities or by third parties acting on Siemens' behalf and/or that may damage the overall reputation of Siemens: - all plausible allegations - of a violation of criminal or administrative law or - of a violation of a Siemens-internal regulation relating to criminal or administrative law (for example, the Business Conduct Guidelines) - all impending or current criminal or administrative proceedings against Siemens AG, one of its Affiliated Companies or one of its employees as well as any related requests for information - all impending or current proceedings by a multilateral development bank (for example, the World Bank) or a credit insurer (for example, Euler Hermes, KfW) as well as any related requests for information - all information regarding intentional violations of accounting regulations – that is, regulations regarding accounting and financial reporting, independent audits of financial statements, bookkeeping and bookkeeping controls - all intentional damages (no lost assets) that occur to the detriment of Siemens AG or its Affiliated Companies and/or occur on the company's properties or projects (in this case also private property) (security incidents, formerly TreuInfo cases) as described in chapter 6 Security incident management, formerly TreuInfo - all information regarding intentionally false reports of compliance cases - all information regarding possible breaches of data privacy law - all information regarding possible money laundering or terrorist financing activities - all information regarding possible human rights violations - all information regarding a violation of export control or embargo regulations - all plausible HR cases, if LC CO IR, at its discretion and in alignment with HR, considers the handling by itself necessary. In contrast to the above items, for matters mentioned under 6) to 9) this is irrespective of whether such activities are performed by Siemens employees or by related or unrelated third parties when Siemens can be held liable for the misconduct. There is no differentiation between local and central compliance cases – there is only one Compliance Case. However, a Compliance Case is to be classified following a risk based approach as high, medium, or low risk The risk level is determined by the risk the case may have: cases which expose Siemens globally are classified as high risk cases cases with exposure to the relevant business unit and / or to the specific regional company only are classified as medium risk cases and cases which do not have any immediate risk exposure at the time they have been reported, are classified as low risk cases. All Compliance Cases will be handled by Compliance Investigation and Regulatory – the bundling of the responsibility in one department ensures that all cases are being handled by experts and in the same way hereby, the high-quality level is guaranteed throughout the handling of all Compliance Cases. Impending or current criminal or administrative proceedings against Siemens AG, one of its Affiliated Companies or one of its employees as well as any related requests for information or any searches must be reported immediately to the local Legal or Compliance department. These units must immediately notify Compliance Investigation and Regulatory (LC CO IR).

All compliance cases that do not meet the criteria set out in point 2.2.1. of this chapter will be classified with medium or low risk. In general, the cases will be handled by LC CO IR in the same way as the high risk cases. However, the Mandating and Reporting process differs: Medium risk cases will be mandated by the Compliance Legal together with the Compliance Officer responsible for the region / the business these are also the ones responsible for issuing the final report. Low risk cases do not require a mandate but will be monitored by Compliance Investigation and Regulatory together with the Compliance Officer responsible. There are also other cases that – although involving violations of Siemens' internal regulations – will not be handled by the Compliance Organization. These cases include, for example, matters in which specialist expertise is required or matters in which no intentional violation of Siemens' internal regulations is alleged. Unless these cases are central compliance cases, they will be forwarded to the relevant specialist department for action. This applies in particular to the following HR-specific matters for which the HR organization is responsible: 1. HR standard processes such as hiring, dismissal, issuance of work permits etc. 2. workplace environment, pay, incentives, calculation of bonuses, workloads, overtime, and all other organizational or procedural HR topics 3. improper favoritism, workplace intimidation, all forms of discrimination, harassment or other inappropriate behavior on the part of coworkers, managers or other company employees 4. irregularities related to travel or organizational expenses 5. improper use or damage of company property 6. matters related to workers councils and unions 7. matters related to pensions The following cases may be taken over by LC CO IR at its discretion and I alignment with HR. Allegations in connection with: - ongoing/imminent governmental or criminal investigations - material damage to the company (more than 50.000 €) - asserted retaliation against a whistleblower - intentional false reporting of compliance cases - allegations against top executives, Country Heads, Heads of Corporate Units, ICFR Certifiers, and senior managers - harassment or discrimination (including, but not limited to, based on race, gender, national origin, sexual orientation) that could result in material financial risk or impact the company's reputation in public opinion or the press. - improper use of social media that could result in material financial risk or impact the company's reputation in public opinion or the press. - allegations of substantial systemic misconduct with significant financial or reputational impact In addition, the GM SEC organization is responsible for the following GM SEC-specific and similar cases with no apparent relation to compliance matters: 1. Sabotage (i.e. to products, machines, production lines, vehicles, etc.) 2. Politically motivated crime (i.e. arson to cars, etc.) 3. Organized crime, gang crime 4. IT and cyber-related crime 5.

The handling of pure work errors at LC CO DP and LC CO EX should be recorded according to the following criteria in a case-by-case analysis in TRACI: • Indications of systematically determined misconduct by the same person or group of people. • Indications of intentional or grossly negligent misconduct by the same person or group of people. • repeat cases. • recurrent process weaknesses and organizational deficits. • If, in relation to the relevant work error and a hypothetical overall view, it can be assumed that an authority / an examiner would initiate an official measure / procedure against Siemens. If LC CO DP or LC CO EX intends to disclose internally identified misconduct by employees and misconduct / process weaknesses through voluntary disclosure and / or other approaches to authorities, this must be reported to the clearing committee via LC CO IR CF. On this basis, LC CO IR CF decides whether a TRACI registration should be carried out (regardless of whether a case has already been initiated by the authorities or not). For further details please see here. In order to provide a uniform system for recording compliance cases (as defined in point 1 of this chapter) within the Compliance Organization, the compliance case tracking tool (TRACI: Tracking Compliance Cases Internationally) was implemented from October 1, 2009 . Governance responsibility for TRACI lies with Compliance Risk Management and Mitigation department (LC CO RFC RC) in conjunction with the head of Compliance Investigation and Regulatory (LC CO IR). The employees of the Compliance Organization worldwide must ensure that all compliance cases known to them are registered immediately in TRACI. The uniform TRACI procedure standardizes and simplifies compliance review reporting. It ensures that all compliance cases that are to be reported to management are known at Compliance Investigation and Regulatory and that Siemens meets its internal and external reporting obligations and can take appropriate measures to investigate potential wrongdoing. Compliance Officers must confirm on a quarterly basis that – to the best of their knowledge and belief – the new cases within their respective areas of responsibility have been accurately and completely entered in TRACI (certification). The tool also enables other Compliance Officers assigned to the previously mentioned Compliance Officers to implement certification. Certification at the end of a quarter is possible up to the tenth business day of the subsequent quarter (U+10). At the end of every quarter, Compliance Investigation and Regulatory analyzes the compliance cases registered in the TRACI system and reports key data to the Chief Compliance Officer, who – jointly with the Chief Counsel Compliance – informs the Managing Board of Siemens AG, the Audit Committee of the Supervisory Board and the independent auditors. The responsibilities for handling compliance cases are set out in section 1 of this chapter. TRACI supports the work processes in the Compliance Organization and reflects the responsibilities for handling a Compliance case. Compliance Investigation and Regulatory will keep the respective Compliance Officers updated on ongoing cases. Effective January 1, 2020, the TreuInfo compliance process will be superseded by IncidentReporting@Siemens (IR@S) in the responsibility of GM SEC. For damages that arise outside GM SEC's area of responsibility (for example, in areas for which LC, SFS CO or HR are responsible), a template for recording key data will be provided. Such cases that also constitute Compliance cases and are reported directly to GM SEC will be forwarded by GM SEC to the Compliance organization for further handling. Further information can be found in chapter 6 Security incident management (formerly TreuInfo). The TRACI application can be accessed from the intranet via https://traci.Compliance.siemens.com/traci. Questions regarding the tool and related topics may be directed to traci-treuinfo.Compliance@siemens.com. Details on the tool are provided by the intranet-based training programs and by information in the tool itself. Due to the sensitivity of the data in the TRACI system and to avoid conflicts of interest and apply a strict need-to-know principle, only those employees of the Compliance Organization who are fully authorized to perform the tasks of the Compliance and Legal organization will have access to TRACI cases. Applications for exceptions must be submitted to Compliance Investigation and Regulatory and accompanied in every case by a written justification. Rights of use and access authorizations for TRACI will be handled via the Finance Portal. Therefore, all entries in the Finance Portal for access authorization must be accurate and complete, and must be updated to take account of any changes. The relevant Compliance Organization will review the accuracy of the entries of all authorized users in the Finance Portal at least once a quarter and correct those entries immediately, if necessary.

The following main principles of a compliance investigation must be complied with: - The responsible investigative unit must conduct an objective and impartial investigation into all reported compliance allegations. Any internal investigation requires a formal mandate . - All Siemens personnel and units engaged in internal investigations and fact-finding activities must perform their duties in a manner that is consistent with applicable laws and Siemens' values. - Inquiries must be conducted on the basis of a presumption of innocence. - The identities of the complainant, witnesses or the subject of the investigation will not be disclosed to third parties unless this is required by law. Internal inquiries regarding ongoing investigations must be handled according to the need-to-know principle. These principles ensure that all investigations are conducted in accordance with the confidentiality requirements and the law within each jurisdiction. - Investigative measures must be suitable, necessary and appropriate for fulfilling the aims of the investigation. - The code of conduct for internal compliance investigations as laid down in chapter 3 Code of conduct for compliance investigations and fact-finding outlines the requirements that must be observed during such activities. The process for evaluating compliance cases comprises the following steps: - The first step is to determine whether a reported case is a compliance case (as defined above). If it is not a compliance case, the matter will be forwarded to the relevant specialist department (HR, GM SEC, EHS etc.) for further action. - If a reported case is a compliance case, the plausibility of the related allegations will be reviewed. If these allegations are not plausible, the case will be closed in the compliance case tracking tool TRACI and will not be pursued further - If the allegations are sufficiently plausible, their substance will be reviewed in a second step to determine if sufficient information is available to permit an internal investigation (a so-called initial suspicion). - If the allegations are sufficiently substantial and the case is a medium risk compliance case, the Compliance Officer together with Compliance Investigation and Regulatory – Compliance Legal will issue an investigation mandate. - If the case is a high risk compliance case, the relevant counsel (case lawyer) at Compliance Investigation and Regulatory will issue an investigation mandate, which will be reviewed by the Head of Compliance Investigation and Regulatory and approved by the Chief Compliance Officer. - Compliance Investigation and Regulatory (LC CO IR), Legal Competition (LC M&A CMP) – particularly in the case of antitrust violations – and third parties may be mandated to conduct investigations of central compliance cases. Compliance Investigation and Regulatory will provide legal support for all investigations of central compliance cases. The local Compliance Office or another local specialist department (for example, HR, Taxes, Export Control or EHS) may be mandated to clarify medium risk compliance cases or individual aspects of compliance cases. - Outside counsel will be mandated by Compliance Investigation and Regulatory if necessary. In order to avoid labour law related deadlines, the responsible local HR and/or legal department should be informed at the earliest possible stage. All mandates will contain - an identifying TRACI number - the name of the unit mandated to conduct the investigation/clarification, and - a statement of the allegations and the Siemens unit involved. In high risk compliance cases, investigations mandates will contain the signatures of the Chief Compliance Officer and the Chief Counsel Compliance. In medium risk compliance cases, investigation mandates will contain the signatures of the relevant lawyer at LC CO IR CF and the relevant Compliance Officer. Mandates may be shown to interviewees for the purpose of authorizing investigative activities. Therefore, in order to protect reporters and ensure the integrity and effectiveness of investigations, they will not contain any information or personal data in addition to the information listed. The Chief Compliance Officer (in high risk compliance cases) or the relevant Lead Country Compliance Officer (in medium risk compliance cases) will inform – on a need-to-know basis – the CEO, CFO, General Counsel and Compliance Officer of the relevant Siemens unit (OPCP, or Business Unit) and of the relevant local unit and/or Lead Country and OPCO that the mandate has been issued.

In its investigation, the investigating unit must comply with the Code of Conduct for Compliance Investigations and Fact-Finding (chapter 3) and all applicable local laws. Its activities must be suitable, necessary and appropriate for fulfilling the aims of its investigation. In the course of its investigation, the investigating unit must accordingly inform the Compliance Officer or Compliance Investigation and Regulatory (in central compliance cases) of all findings on a regular basis so that they may review the appropriateness of the investigative measures to be implemented. In high risk compliance cases, the Chief Counsel Compliance must be directly informed of all findings on a regular basis so that he or she may review the appropriateness of the investigative measures to be implemented. Violations by fact-finding units of the Code of Conduct for Compliance Investigations and Fact-Finding may be deemed compliance cases and sanctioned accordingly. Employees must be notified of any investigations – and in particular of any collection of data – relating to them to the extent that such notification does not endanger the purpose of the investigation. Data may be collected only to the extent permitted under applicable local law. An agreement regarding the aspects of compliance investigations governed by labor law and data privacy law has been concluded with the Central Works Council of Siemens AG . The investigating units will submit and sign an application for data mirroring and collection (Data Collection Request – DCR). The DCR will be forwarded to Compliance Investigation and Regulatory for review. Compliance Investigation and Regulatory will consult the Data Privacy Organization to ensure that the DCR complies with data privacy laws. DCRs will be approved and signed by the relevant counsel at Compliance Investigation and Regulatory and the Chief Counsel Compliance. After concluding their investigations, investigating units will issue investigation reports. These reports, which must be approved by Compliance Investigation and Regulatory will include a description of the investigation/clarification framework, the findings of the investigation, the legal assessment of those findings and any related recommendations for action. In cases where the investigating/clarifying units did not substantiate a wrongdoing by an employee, the employee concerned should receive a Clearance Letter, if legally permissible under local law. In high risk compliance cases, the Chief Compliance Officer will provide the reports to all relevant individuals on a need-to-know basis and to Compliance Investigation and Regulatory Discipline and Remediation (LC CO IR RD). If disciplinary measures are required, the reports will also be forwarded to the relevant HR department. In medium risk compliance cases, the responsible Compliance Officer will provide the reports to the relevant individuals on a need-to-know basis. Investigation reports must always be treated confidentially and may not be distributed further without the prior consent of the Chief Compliance Officer (in high risk compliance cases) or the responsible lawyer from Compliance Investigation and Regulatory (in medium risk compliance cases), Retaliation of any kind against individuals who have reported complaints or compliance cases in good faith will not be tolerated. This prohibition applies to any action that may directly or indirectly harm the employment relationship, earning potential, bonus payments, career development or other work-related interests of the reporter. Disciplinary sanctions imposed in a due process in response to a reporter's involvement in any reported wrongdoing are not regarded as retaliation under this policy. Reporting of retaliatory actions Employees who notice or learn of a current or impending retaliatory action should immediately inform Compliance Case Handling (LC CO IR) either directly or via a member of the Siemens Compliance Organization. Compliance Case Handling will immediately take all steps necessary to protect the interests of the relevant employees. There may also be an internal investigation into the allegations. If such an investigation finds that this policy has been violated, appropriate measures will be taken. These measures may include disciplinary measures against the individuals who are responsible for and/or have taken part in the impermissible retaliatory actions. Documentation of disciplinary measures If disciplinary measures or other measures under labor law are taken against an employee who has reported a compliance case, Compliance Case Handling must be informed immediately. If such measures are not connected with the reporting of a compliance case, the facts, the chronology and the basis for the measures must be documented by the relevant manager prior to their implementation.

{"text": "The most important aspect in all Compliance matters is to follow our principles. The focus lies on everyone's judgement and self-responsibility. However, Compliance prevention also requires additional processes and measures due diligences and approvals are the most frequent ones. Please also refer to Siemens Circular No. 226 for an overview of all other major Compliance related obligations. Compliance Due Diligences The prevention of Compliance incidents has an overall similarity throughout the different Compliance topics: the need for transparency. Only a sufficient transparency puts Siemens in the position to assess the risks connected with a third party or a transaction. Therefore, the common approach for most Compliance topics is the performance of some kind of due diligence. The link between processes for Business Partner, Anti-Money-Laundering and Human Rights will be a common Due Diligence Tool in the future. But also Export Control requires inter alia checks of the end-user and the end-use of the Siemens product. Approvals Approvals are additional safeguards to involve a second opinion and to set a certain standard for the justification of a certain intended behavior or action. They are often integrated in due diligence processes but may also appear separately, e.g. in the area of Gifts and Hospitality.

In case of deviations, the regulations of the respective topic chapter prevail. Below you can find an overview of the most important Compliance due diligence processes. Please keep in mind that the binding content regarding those processes is contained in the respective chapter of the corresponding Compliance Activity Field. - Business Partner A Business Partner Compliance Due Diligence (Chapter A 4.A.4.) has to be initiated in the CDD Tool by anyone intending to make business with the following types and certain contract provisions (Chapter A 4.B.5.) need to be included in a contract with them: - Intermediaries - Sales-related Intermediaries , e.g. Sales Agents, Business Consultants - Non-sales related Intermediaries , incl. Lobbyists and Customs Agents. - Resellers with Red Flags - Value-add Reseller , e.g. EPC, OEM / System Integrator - Distributor / other Reseller. - For these Resellers, a Compliance Due Diligence or the use of certain contract provisions is only mandatory in case of one of the following Red Flags : - The use of the specific Reseller is required by a third party, e.g. an end customer - The Reseller receives an unusual financial benefit or business term from Siemens - The Reseller places another third party between himself and his customer without plausible cause - The Reseller raises integrity concerns based on information from a reliable source. - Cooperation/Consortium Partners - Compliance in Projects A Compliance Risk Assessment incl. a Compliance Due Diligence has to be conducted in project sales (Chapter H 1.2.1.) and project execution (Chapter H 1.3.1.) if certain trigger criteria are fulfilled. - Anti-Money-Laundering In case of an indication of money laundering or terrorism financing ( AML Red Flag, Chapter C.1.)in relation to a Counterpart, its Business Model, the Transaction / Financing e.g. • Unusual or implausible business activities or • Indications for disguising the source of funds and/or involved persons or even a concrete suspicion of money laundering or terrorism financing, the responsible Compliance Officer must be informed and an AML-specific Due Diligence (AML DD) must be performed (Chapter C. 2.) before entering into, or continuing with a business relationship or performing any transaction with a Counterpart. Where required by local / sector specific AML regulations, additional or deviating measures might have to be taken (Chapter C.3.). - Human Rights A Human Rights due diligence as a module of the assessment of compliance risks within the LoA process (Chapter H. 1.2.1.) has to be performed if certain trigger criteria are fulfilled. Please see chapter Chapter E 5. for more details. - Procurement The incorporated compliance check in the supplier registration of SCM STAR/PEGA SMDM on global layer level consists of the Business Partner (BP) check (Chapter A 4.A.4.) and an assessment of an AML risk (Chapter C. 2.). - Export Control The company application DAMEX must be used to evaluate what restrictions are applicable for a business transaction: - DAMEX-E (End-Use Check) Questions about ultimate destination, end use and other warning indicators. Military and nuclear use, deliveries to certain persons, companies and organizations and certain services, such as technical support, may be subject to restrictions in the form of prohibitions and compulsory licensing. - DAMEX-P (Product-Specific Check) Goods-related check at item level determining a possible license requirement fort the export of the respective item (commodity, software, technology) - DAMEX-SPS (Sanctioned Parties Screening) Contains various lists of sanctions of the respective national, European and US authorities.

{"text": "Our basic principles guide our decisions and overall conduct as employees of Siemens We comply with the applicable laws of the countries in which we operate and ensure the implementation of all company guidelines, processes, and controls. What laws must we obey? We must be aware of and comply with the laws and regulations that apply to our daily work. These laws and regulations may vary from country to country. If we are uncertain or have questions, we contact Legal and Compliance. What are the consequences for our company and for us as employees? Violations of the law or failure to comply with the Business Conduct Guidelines can have serious consequences for our company and us. These consequences can be... ...for each of us: 1. disciplinary action 2. fines and damages 3. imprisonment ...for our company: 1. damage to Siemens' reputation, brand and market value 2. significant fines and damages 3. disgorgement of profit 4. exclusion from public and private contracts We ask ourselves the following questions when making decisions for Siemens: - Is it right for Siemens? Is it in line with Siemens' values and our values? - Is it legal? - Could it affect our brand if our decision becomes the subject or media coverage? - What would the people we care about think of our decision? - Are we prepared to take responsibility for our decision? We respect the personal dignity, privacy, and rights of each individual. We believe diversity enriches our workplace. We work together without regard to ethnic origin, culture, religion, age, disability, skin color, gender, sexual identity and orientation, or worldview. We do not tolerate discrimination, sexual or any other form of harassment, or inappropriate behavior toward individuals or groups. We apply these principles of respect to each other and third-parties with whom we interact, including our suppliers, customers, and business partners. We interact with each other in a respectful and reliable manner. What does this mean in practice? What behavior is unacceptable? Here are a few examples: - Racially, offensive or xenophobic material is placed on a colleague's desk - Innuendo or comments hostile to the disabled - Gender-specific harassment or violence, including assaults, unwanted advances or improper remarks or jokes - Displaying improper images or objects, including those with sexual content. We are open and honest. We take our responsibility seriously, we are reliable, and we only make promises we can keep. We are sincere. We help clarify and eliminate potential deficiencies, problems, and misunderstandings. We do everything to fulfill the trust placed in us by our customers and the users of our products, services, and industry solutions. What do we do when we make a mistake? We all make mistakes at work. We foster a culture where we learn from our mistakes. We deal openly with them to prevent them from recurring. This is the only way to learn from mistakes and help prevent them from recurring. While most mistakes are minor, others could have serious consequences and should be reported. What do we do if we observe a violation of the Business Conduct Guidelines? We do not look away when we recognize possible violations of the Business Conduct Guidelines, even if they do not involve us personally. The company has numerous outlets to report possible violations of the Business Conduct Guidelines (see Chapter Our reporting procedures). In many cases, timely reporting is important to avoid or minimize negative consequences to the company. We protect and promote Siemens' reputation and values. They are essential for our business success and ensure the sustainable future of our company. If we act illegally or inappropriately, we can cause considerable damage to the company. As managers, we bear s special responsibility and we take seriously our duty of care for the employees entrusted to us. We create a trusting working environment and are always available to discuss with our employees uncertainties, compliance with legal requirements, questions, or professional and personal concerns with our employees. We set a good example and ensure our teams understand the importance of acting in accordance with the Business Conduct Guidelines. We take every indication of possible misconduct seriously and report it to Legal and Compliance. We protect the identity of employees who report potential misconduct and protect them from retaliation or other negative impact. We fulfill our organizational and supervisory duties. Our mangers lead by example and set the appropriate tone from the top. What are our organizational and supervisory duties? - We carefully select employees based on their personal and professional qualifications and suitability. The duty of care increases with the importance of the task the employee has to perform (Duty of Selection). - We define binding tasks precisely and completely, especially with regard to compliance with legal requirements (Duty to Issue Instructions). - We ensure that compliance with", "metadata": "BCGs-1"}

(Duty to Communicate). Our Manager´s special responsibilities and duties do not release us from our own responsibilities as employees. We must work together to comply with the law and Siemens guidelines. We make real what matters! Siemens protects our fundamental rights as employees, our health, our personal security, and occupational safety at all locations throughout the world and when we are on business travel. Siemens fosters fair cooperation among management, employees, and employee representatives, and protects the fundamental rights of its employees: No discrimination or intimidation The principles of equal opportunity and equal treatment are guaranteed without regard to skin color, ethnic or social origin, religion, age, disability, sexual identity, worldview, or gender.

Even in the event of disputes, Siemens strives to ensure sustainable and constructive cooperation in the long term and for solutions that reflect the interests of the company and the interests of its employees. Siemens cares about us as part of its corporate responsibility. Our health: Siemens protects and promotes our health and well-being, guards against the risk of work-related accidents, and offers a wide-range of support to maintain and promote our physical and mental health. Our occupational safety: Siemens provides a safe work environment to ensure employees return home healthy and unharmed at the end of the working day. We ourselves contribute to this: This is what we do: - We observe the safety regulations at our workplace - We avoid risky behavior - When We recognize dangerous situations, we take appropriate action Our personal security: Siemens is active worldwide, including in areas and situations where the security situation is critical. To protect our employees, the company, and our business in the best possible way, Siemens identifies and analyzes global security risks and assesses their potential impact. This is what we do: - We educate ourselves in advance about the security risks in the countries to which we will be traveling and comply with prescribed security procedures and requirements. - We do not expose ourselves or our colleagues to unnecessary hazards through reckless behavior or by ignoring security regulations. - We react quickly in a critical situation, contact the emergency hotline at +49 (89) 636 – 12345 (staffed 24 hours a day), and follow the relevant security instructions. - We report security incidents promptly to our security officer and/or use the security incident reporting tool IncidentReporting@Siemens(IR@S). Further information about protecting the safety of our employees and our corporate values can be found on the Intranet. Our employees are our most valuable asset. Your health and safety are our top priority. We reject all forms of corruption and bribery. We do not tolerate any form of corruption in our business dealings anywhere in the world. This includes our business dealings through our external partners Corruption is dishonest or illegal behavior, especially by people in power, typically involving bribery. It can also include other acts, such as fraud, embezzlement, favoritism, and nepotism. This is what we do: - We do not actively or passively engage in any form of corrupt conduct. - We report all suspected corrupt activity to our Legal and Compliance organization. The most common form of corruption is bribery. Siemens does not tolerate any form of bribery. Bribery is the act of offering, promising, or giving money, gifts, or other benefit to a public official or public or private employee with the aim of receiving improper advantages. Bribery is a criminal offense worldwide. The term public official or member of t he public sector covers any person employed by or commissioned by a public authority. This includes all government officials and employees of non-governmental institutions who are regarded as public officials in accordance with applicable law. We do", "metadata": "BCGs-2"}
{"text": "not tolerate any form of bribery. This is what we do: We do not: - give or accept excessive gifts or entertainment - give or accept excessive travel expenses - give or accept inappropriate donations, sponsorship, or memberships - give or accept inappropriate monetary payments - use third-parties to bribe on Siemens' behalf or - give or accept improper facilitation payments. What are facilitation payments? A facilitation payment is the payment of a relatively small amount of money, or the granting of any other benefit, usually to low-ranking public officials, for their personal benefit or to expedite the performance of a routine governmental action. Facilitation payments are prohibited and can be prosecuted. Further information on the topic of facilitation payments can be found on the Compliance Intranet or Compliance Handbook. Gifts and hospitality – yes, but only to a reasonable extent In many cultures, gifts and invitations to entertainment events are important for developing and deepening business relationships. However, some gifts and invitations may unreasonably influence the recipient's decision-making or create the appearance of improper influence. This is what we do: - We do not provide overly generous gifts or hospitality. - We do not provide gifts or hospitality in exchange for business or other benefits. Gifts and hospitality must: - be in accordance with applicable laws and regulations Regulations Our business counterparts, especially government officials, often have their own internal rules that restrict their ability to accept gifts and hospitality. These rules can be very strict and we must be aware of and adhere to them: - be transparent and correctly recorded in the company's books and records - be appropriate in terms of type, value, and frequency to the occasion and the position of the recipient - not be offered, provided, demanded, or accepted with the expectation of any type of advantage and - never give the appearance of dishonesty or inappropriateness. What do I have to consider with gifts and hospitality? - You will find the answers to these questions in the Video Gifts and hospitality - You will find out about country-specific requirements via the WorldMap. - Details on the subject of gifts and hospitality can be found in the Compliance Intranet or Compliance Handbook. Sponsorships, donations, charitable contributions, and memberships – yes, but only to promote corporate goals Sponsorships, donations, charitable contributions, and memberships are important to our social commitment and the pursuit of our corporate goals. This is what we do: Sponsorships, donations, charitable contributions, and memberships: - must be carefully examined to determine whether they promote the company's legitimate objectives - may not be promised, offered, or made to obtain improper business advantages or for other unethical purposes - must be religiously and politically neutral and - must strengthen our brand and our social commitments. It is not enough to consider legal requirements alone. Details on sponsorship, donations, charitable contributions, and memberships can be found in Siemens Circular No. 186, Principles for Sponsoring Activities, Donations and Charitable Contributions, as well as Membership , Compliance Intranet or Compliance Handbook. Political engagement Continuous dialog with political decision-makers is highly relevant for the success of a global company. We are committed to political neutrality. Siemens activities with respect to politicians, parties, and positions will be non- partisan and solely in support of Siemens business goals. We comply with the law and Siemens guidelines. Payment of travel expenses – yes, but only when reasonable and allowable Siemens may be required to pay third-party travel expenses in certain business transactions. However, excessive reimbursement can inappropriately influence the recipient or at least create the appearance of influence. This is what we do: - We only pay justified and appropriate travel expenses. - We adhere to the aforementioned regulations for gifts and hospitality. Outgoing payments – yes, but only if used lawfully Payments to third-parties are made every day in the course of business at Siemens. Processes and tools help us ensure these payments are properly documented and provided for proper purposes. This is what we do: - We only maintain accounts or funds for legitimate purposes. - We only make payments to third-parties that are legal and have legitimate purposes. - We only make payments when there is proper documentation. Involvement of third-parties – yes, but without bribery There are many legitimate reasons for involving thirdparties in business relationships. However, using thirdparties to unlawfully or improperly influence public officials or private individuals is prohibited. We therefore scrutinize business partners at the beginning of our business relationships and monitor the relationships as they develop. This is what we do: - We scrutinize and monitor business partners and take into account their respective risks. - We are committed to ensuring that our partners in our value chain know and adhere to our values and compliance standards. - We insist on contract", "metadata": "BCGs-3"}
{"text": "provisions that require our business partners to act in compliance with all applicable rules and regulations. Further information on business partners can be found on the Compliance Intranet or Compliance Handbook. Here are some red flags we must critically question and clarify: - Inconsistencies in records and payments - High prices with deep discounts or unduly high profit margins - Contractual partners with unclear responsibilities or questionable qualifications - Suspicious personal relationships or business arrangements - Unusually high fees, commissions, gifts, entertainment, or hospitality - The rejection of anti-corruption contract clauses - The demand for prepayment without plausible business reasons and - Demands for cash payments or transfers to offshore bank accounts or third-parties. I will not sell the future for instant profit. Werner von Siemens Antitrust law protects free, undistorted, and effective competition for the benefit of customers, companies, and society as a whole. Antitrust violations can have serious consequences for our company and the employees involved, such as high fines, exclusion from public tenders, claims for damages, damage to reputation, and imprisonment. This is what we do: - We never enter into anticompetitive agreements with competitors. What are anticompetitive agreements? Anticompetitive agreements include price agreements, market, customer, or territory allocations, and project agreements with competitors. Abusing a dominant position (indicator: more than 30 to 50 percent market share) is also prohibited. This is what we do: - We only talk to competitors if we have a compelling business reason and there are no antitrust concerns. We never talk to competitors about: - Prices, price components, or other conditions - Market, customer, or territory allocation - Business opportunities or incoming orders - Capacities, production volumes, or quotas - Corporate strategies or future market behavior for example, sales strategies, current and future product developments, investments, and boycotts - Offers and tenders and - Conduct during tenders or the submission of bogus offers. This is what we do: - We also support open competition in our relationships with customers, sales partners, and suppliers. - We never talk to customers, sales partners, or suppliers about: - Adherence to resale prices. In many cases, however, non-binding recommendations, without pressure or incentives, regarding resale prices and the establishment of maximum sale prices are permissible or - Obstruction of exports or re-imports. - We handle confidential information from Siemens and third-parties, such as competitors, customers, sales partners, and suppliers, with care. What is confidential information that deserves special protection? Confidential information is information that is not intended to be made public. This may include non-public information from or about Siemens, suppliers, customers, employees, agents, consultants, or other third-parties that is protected under legal and contractual requirements. This can include, for example: - details of a company's organization and facilities, prices, sales, profits, markets, customers, and other business matters - offer documents - information on manufacturing, research, and development processes - technical information and - internal reporting figures. A few examples of what we do not do: - We never obtain confidential information from third- parties without justification and use it in an unlawful manner, such as, for example, in the bidding process. - We do not use confidential documents from previous employers or store them on Siemens networks. Further information on antitrust law and fair competition can be found on the Compliance Intranet page with numerous Quick Guides. This is what we do: - For products where Siemens may have a dominant position (indicator: greater than 30 to 50 percent market share), we contact Legal and Compliance when confronted with the following types of conduct: - exclusivity agreements or loyalty discounts - excessively high or low competitive prices - coupled sale of a strong market product with other products - unequal treatment of business partners (except where there is an objective justification, such as, for example, different sales prices due to a volume discount) or - refusal of delivery or license (without an objective justification). - We have potentially anticompetitive business partnerships examined in advance by Legal and Compliance, such as: - working/bidding partnerships, consortia - joint research and development - specialization/joint production - standardization and harmonization - joint purchasing - exclusive distribution/exclusive procurement - market information systems/benchmarking and - Exclusivity agreements and exclusive territory allocation in distribution and licensing agreements. - We only participate in association meetings if there is a written invitation with an agenda, representatives of the association are present, and minutes are kept. Further information can be found in the Recommendations for action in working with associations. As a company with international operations, it is essential for Siemens to comply with the export control and customs regulations applicable to national and international trade. This is what we do: - We carefully ensure that the applicable customs and foreign trade regulations, including regulations on security in the supply chain, are checked, implemented,", "metadata": "BCGs-4"}
{"text": "and complied with when goods are traded or transported, services are provided, or other technical know-how or software is transferred. - We thoroughly audit business in sanctioned countries. - We ensure that all applicable export control regulations (such as those of the European Union and the United States) are checked and complied with in Siemens' business activities, even outside the respective territories. - We distance ourselves from a transaction and alert Export Control when there are indications of possible infringements or unauthorized use of our products, services, or industry solutions. Detailed information and contacts on the subject of export control can be found in Siemens Circular No. 226, Global Compliance, on the Intranet page Export Control and in the Internal Export Control Program (EX-ICP) with its various quick guides. Detailed information and contacts on the subject of customs can be found on the intranet page Customs, in the Internal Customs Control Program (Customs ICP) and in Siemens Circular No. 234, Principles of Customs Law. Siemens faces significant compliance risks in numerous markets. Collective Action is our strategic response to this challenge. Together with other companies, the public sector, and civil society, we enter into integrity and compliance pacts with our partners for business cooperation and support binding agreements for individual sectors and markets. Through these joint efforts, we aim to create fair, level, and clean market conditions for all participants. How do We assemble the right players to make a difference together? You will find the answers here. Detailed information on Collective Action can be found on the Compliance Intranet page with videos on his topic. The Siemens brand is a promise of innovation and quality. It must be relevant, tangible, and capable of being experienced. And it has to open doors all over the world. That is the case today. And it should remain that way in the future. The Siemens brand: A promise of innovation and quality The Siemens brand is an integral part of our business and, therefore, has significant strategic importance. It is one of our major corporate assets and competencies, generates trust, and has a positive effect on all our business activities. With the Siemens brand, we distinguish ourselves from the competition. This is what we do: - We are innovative and constantly working on new business ideas. However, we always make decisions to protect or strengthen the Siemens brand, not in favor of a particular business alone. - When in doubt and before making a decision regarding the Siemens brand, we contact the Brand Design Hotline (design-support.communications@siemens.com). In addition to the Siemens brand, intellectual property rights, patents, copyrights, and confidential know-how, and their protection, are essential for our business success. This is what we do: - We, as inventors, support Siemens by filing for intellectual property rights in a timely manner. - We report suspected violations of our intellectual property rights. - We use computer software only in accordance with applicable license terms and ensure compliance with all license requirements of integrated thirdparty software, commercial, and open source software, in our products and solutions. - We respect the intellectual property rights of thirdparties. Handling of the Siemens brand and other intellectual property rights What makes the Siemens brand so valuable? The brand... - provides focus to our stakeholders, such as customers, employees, etc. - distinguishes us from the competition, and - ultimately generates trust. Why are intellectual property rights so important to Siemens? If our innovations are not protected, third-parties can copy our products, which leads to a loss of competitive advantage. When our innovations are infringed, we lose the value of our investments in research and development. Conflicts of interest – we only make business decisions in the interest of Siemens We are not influenced by personal interests when making business decisions. Such conflicts of interest can hinder Siemens' success in that decisions are made contrary to Siemens' interest, customers are driven away, or important information is disclosed. Conflicts of interest may, for example: - harm Siemens if contracts are awarded on the basis of personal relationships that contain inferior terms from those of competitors and - lead to reputational damage if they are made public dissatisfied employees or former customers could communicate conflicts to the outside world. There is a conflict of interest in day-to-day business if our personal interests differ from those of Siemens. This is what we do: - We make business decisions in the best interest of our company and not on the basis of personal interests. - We anticipate and avoid situations in which the appearance of a conflict of interest may arise. - We do not, as part of our work for Siemens, engage companies with which we have a personal interest if it could personally benefit us, whether or not we have or can exert direct", "metadata": "BCGs-5"}
{"text": "or indirect influence on Siemens' business decision. - We inform our managers of any personal interest that might exist in connection with the performance of our official duties. To protect ourselves and our company, we pay close attention to possible conflicts of interest. The following questions help us assess whether there is a conflict or an appearance of a conflict: - Is the decision we make for Siemens influenced by personal interests? - What impression would the situation leave on third- parties, such as customers, business partners, and investors? - How would the public react to my business decision? Here is a classic example of an internal conflict of interest: There is an intimate relationship between an employee and a manager. The manager is obliged to disclose the conflict of interest at an early stage and change the reporting relationship. Question: Is it okay if I select a supplier in whose company a close relative or a good friend is the contact person for Siemens? Answer: Possibly, but only if you do it in a transparent manner. You should inform your manager immediately. In addition, there must be a clear separation of duties and independent supervision, so there is not even a suggestion of a conflict and no undue advantages are offered in either direction. Question: Can I hire a relative or good friend? Answer: Possibly. However, you must follow the regular Human Resources recruitment process and disclose the relationship right from the start. For more information on conflicts of interest, see the Compliance Handbook. A conflict of interest may also arise in business relationships with or through investments in a competitor or customer of Siemens. This is what we do: - We do not operate or work for a company that competes with Siemens. - We do not engage in any activity that competes with Siemens. Typical examples of a competitive situation: - The employee also works for or advises a competitor of Siemens. - The employee himself competes directly with Siemens. - There are personal or family ties to competitors. A conflict may also arise in the performance of secondary employments that prevent us from properly performing our duties at Siemens. This is what we do: - Before we engage in paid secondary employment, we consult with our managers. We inform the Human Resources department in writing that we would like to take up paid secondary employment and will only do so after obtaining written consent. Secondary employment can only be prohibited, and previously granted permission can be revoked, if it leads to an impairment of the employee's work performance, interferes with his or her duties within the company, or if there is a risk of a conflict of interest. Occasional writing, lecturing, and similar activities, and temporary seasonal or clerical work are not regarded as secondary employment. Question: Can unpaid activities also be viewed as secondary employment? Answer: Basically, no. If in doubt, please contact the relevant Human Resources representative. Question: What could be the negative consequences of unauthorized secondary employment for Siemens? Answer: One example is an accident at work caused gy your being overtired, exhausted, or unable to concentrate due to the additional stress caused by your secondary employment. Conflicts of interest can also arise through investments in third-party companies. This is what we do: - We inform the Human Resources department in writing of any direct or indirect investment in companies: - that are business partners of Siemens if we are engaged in business with the company or have a board or management role in the company. With respect to publicly traded companies, this only applies if the investment exceeds three percent of the total capital or - that compete with our company if we can influence the management of the competitor through this investment. This is presumed if the interest exceeds three percent of the total capital of the company. Question: Are there other forms of influence on a company to consider besides direct or indirect investment? Answer: Yes. Occasionally, our employees are offered seats on boards of other companies or organizations. Because this could lead to conflicts of interest and legal issues, these activities require Siemens' approval. Money laundering and the funding of terrorism – not with us! Delivery and supply activities entail the risk of being abused for money laundering or terrorist financing. Siemens strives to maintain business relationships only with reputable customers, partners, and companies whose business activities comply with legal requirements and whose financial resources are of legitimate origin. Money laundering is the disguising of the origin of money or other assets from criminal activities and moving them into the legitimate economy. In addition to monetary support, the funding of terrorism may include other assets such as goods or merchandise. Why do criminals launder money? How does money laundering", "metadata": "BCGs-6"}
{"text": "work? What is terrorism funding? How can I prevent business partners from misusing Siemens to launder money or fund illegal activities or terrorism? You will find the answers to these questions in the video „Money Laundering Prevention at Siemens. Further information on money laundering prevention can be found on the Compliance Intranet or Compliance Handbook. This is what we do: - We use a risk-based approach to verify the identity and economic background of customers, business partners, and other third-parties, and the origin of payments to ensure they come from legitimate sources. - We immediately inform Legal and Compliance or our manager in the event of suspicious activity. When necessary, Siemens reports suspicious activity to law enforcement authorities. Warning signs of money laundering or terrorist funding include: - payments channeled through a shell company, a bank account located in a tax haven, or an unknown third party - overpayments and the desire for rapid reimbursement, especially to an account other than the origin - desire for cash payment - an unusually large deposit - an unusual or unnecessarily complicated, business model for the Siemens product - the business partner does not have the necessary processes, human resources, or financial resources - refusal to meet in person. Further examples can be found in the Red Flag catalogue in the Red Flag Catalog on the Intranet page No opportunity for money Laundering.. Financial integrity – this is how we strengthen the trust placed in us As an international company, Siemens is committed to accurate and truthful reporting to investors, employees, customers, business partners, the public, and all government agencies. We follow all applicable laws, regulations, standards, and practices. This is what we do: - We ensure our books and records are kept completely, accurately, and truthfully. They are prepared on time and in accordance with the applicable rules and standards. - We comply with the Financial Reporting Guidelines and follow internal control processes. - We provide correct and complete information for financial reporting purposes. Our accounts and records include all data, certificates, and other written materials provided for financial reporting and disclosure purposes, and materials collected for other purposes. This is what we do: - When applying tax laws, or in the event of conflicts between tax regulations, we ensure the tax result is consistent with the relevant economic and legal circumstances and our business models. - We do not use artificial structures or letterbox companies whose sole purpose is to obtain unlawful tax advantages. - We provide tax authorities with transparent information on our tax strategy and business activities in accordance with existing regulations. For further information, please refer to the Financial Reporting Guidelines and the Risk and Internal Control Manual. Am I responsible for tax matters even if I do not work directly in the Finance or Tax Department? Yes. We are all responsible for tax matters in the context of our business activities. The correct fiscal representation of a business activity is not only the responsibility of the Finance or Tax Department. All transactions must be reflected correctly for tax purposes. For example, a customer invoice must contain, among other things, accurate information about the content of the service provided and the correct VAT. I am planning a business transaction with a customer abroad. What do I have to do from a tax perspective? If you are unsure about the tax consequences of the transaction, contact the Tax Department for advice. Insider trading – neither for us, nor for others! Insider information may not be used or disclosed without authorization. What is insider information? In our work, we often come into contact with confidential information. If it becomes known, some of this information may even be important enough to have a material effect on the share price of Siemens or another company, such as, for example, one of our publicly traded customers or suppliers, one of our publicly traded subsidiaries, or a joint venture partner. This is called insider information as long as it has not yet been published. Insider information can also consist of many individual pieces of information that we have gained, for example, from discussions and documents inside and outside the company or received incidentally. Our individual knowledge of the situation always matters. What is an insider and what are the consequences of being an insider? An insider is someone who has inside information. This person is subject to strict legal requirements. In almost all countries in which Siemens operates, there are severe sanctions for the prohibited use of insider information. Such misuse could have considerable consequences for the company concerned, and result in personal and criminal liability. In case of questions about insider/ insider information, We refer to the information provided in Section 4 of the Communication Principles and in Circular No. 119 (insider list).", "metadata": "BCGs-7"}
{"text": "This is what we do: - We do not engage in transactions based on insider information, such as the purchase or sale of a share or option or the cancellation of a share purchase order, for us or for others. - We do not induce others, such as friends or bank advisors, to engage in securities transactions on the basis of insider information, and we do not recommend such transactions to them. - We treat insider and potential insider information with strict confidentiality and ensure that unauthorized persons cannot gain access to it. How do we know if we are an insider? We must consider whether information we receive can have a significant impact on our share price such that, if disclosed, it represents insider information. Ultimately, Siemens cannot make this decision for us. Furthermore, it is not the formal inclusion in an insider list that is decisive, but whether we are actually aware of insider information. Whether an insider list is opened and who is included in it should be viewed as a separate decision to be made by the company. This also applies to insider information that concerns another company. Can we be sure we are not violating the ban on insider trading when participating in employee stock ownership programs? Siemens strives to enable us to participate in employee stock ownership programs with the lowest possible risk of violating the insider trading prohibition. However, this does not rule out the possibility that we may have knowledge of insider information in individual cases. Therefore, when actively participating in employee stock programs, we should always ask ourselves whether we can make the purchase or sale decisions without being influenced by possible insider information. How we responsibly protect our corporate assets Our corporate assets are essential to our business success. For this reason, we ensure that these assets are handled responsibly and fully protected. As employees, we play a decisive role in achieving this goal. We identify our critical corporate assets and implement protection measures to adequately protect them In order to adequately protect our corporate assets, we need to know and evaluate them. This is what we do: - We identify critical business assets in our respective areas of responsibility and classify them according to their potential impact in the event of a security incident. - We develop and implement holistic protection measures based on the classification of corporate assets. - We ensure the sustainable protection of our corporate assets by regularly reviewing the classifications and protection measures. Siemens attaches great importance to ensuring that sensitive company information cannot fall into the hands of unauthorized persons or third-parties.

{"text": "This Chapter on compliance training provides employees of the Siemens compliance organization who deal with training topics with comprehensive instructions on developing and holding compliance training for the business organization. Compliance training comprises general compliance training, as well as measures related to the activity fields, including in particular export control. It does not cover training on processes or tools. If individual training measures are defined as part of an investigation, the regulations governing them are defined in Chapter L.5. This Chapter contains the required guidelines for Compliance Officers, including the content, suitable methods and time of training and its target groups. The Compliance Training Circle (CTCircle) is the cross-organizational cooperation network with end-to-end responsibility for providing business-related compliance training materials and the related training infrastructure. The main institutions of the CTCircle are: - Core Team : The Core Team comprises at least three members (covering the perspectives of headquarters/governance, business and the regions/countries). It is responsible for the global training strategy and its operationalization. The Core Team defines all the stipulations and regulations in connection with internal compliance training activities centrally and in this context has global authority to issue guidelines in coordination with the Steering Committee. - Steering Committee (SteerCo): The Steering Committee (SteerCo) consists of at least three members from the CMC and LC C GF. They decide on all requirements and regulations relating to compliance training activities on the basis of recommendations from the Core Team. - Country Compliance Officers : The Country Compliance Officers are responsible in the local Siemens organization for giving advice and recommendations on implementing training requirements on the basis of binding global standards and identified local risks (such as CRA results). In accordance with Circular 226, Chapter 2.2, the local CEO or Head of the Company Unit is responsible for ensuring appropriate training measures are held. - Regional Training Coordinators (RTCs): The Regional Training Coordinators (RTCs) are distributed over five regions (incl. SMO) and are based solely on regional affiliation (not AREs). They are the interface between the Core Team and Compliance Officers and facilitate local implementation of the training requirements. They are appointed by the Core Team following agreement in their area of responsibility and administered in the Training Contact Data Base. Exception: SFS/CF F is not covered and represented by the RTCs, but is responsible on its own for all organization-related training measures. News, innovations and information are communicated promptly and comprehensively by the Core Team to the global training network. The RTCs act as local multipliers for the regions/countries and communicate information from the Core Team to the units they represent, such as associated countries or Business Units, if such information is not communicated globally. Information is communicated by e-mail, as well as by regular team meetings. The Country Compliance Officers and RTCs are informed about current training projects of the CTCircle at a regular meeting (CTCircle Update). In addition, a regular CTCircle Update newsletter is sent to the entire compliance organization (including antitrust law). 1. Siemens' compliance training portfolio differentiates between three types of training: Online training (web-based training (WBT), explainer videos, e-seminars) denotes all training activities that are to be held electronically without a trainer. Participants have flexibility in choosing when and from where to complete the training and can do so using various electronic devices. Moderated training (in-person training, virtual training, jointly termed instructor-led training (ILT)) comprises any form of guided training, in particular by a trainer. If required, this training can also be held virtually by means of suitable conferencing technology (such as Microsoft Teams). From 01 October 2021, all globally mandatory training will take place exclusively in the form of online training. From this date, ILTs can be offered as non-compulsory learning opportunities. In the period up to October 01, 2021, ILTs can continue to be held locally on a mandatory basis according to local requirements. Awareness measures (such as Integrity Dialog, Yammer Nuggets) denotes training and/or communication measures to publicize and raise awareness about (new) topics. They are usually short, attention-grabbing formats. The focus here is less on conveying detailed knowledge, but rather on creating and maintaining constant awareness for compliance issues and integrity. They enable managers to discuss compliance issues that arise with their employees. The annual Integrity Dialog can be staged in two ways: - Integrity Moments (binding global minimum standard with four different formats at choice, to be conducted at least once a year): 1) In the spirit of tone from the top/middle, managers integrate a compliance issue lasting 2 to 5 minutes in the form of a short single-page slide presentation or 2) explanation videos (which are provided centrally) in other presentations/talks (e.g. Team jour fixes). 2) Top management (tone from the top) sends out a hot topic e-mail/post (Yammer) to as many employees as possible so as to", "metadata": "1. Training-1"}
{"text": "create awareness for specific compliance issues. 3) Yammer Nuggets (tiny posters that can be sent by e-mail/Yammer) are provided to recapitulate and dig deeper into the content that is conveyed. - Integrity Dialog Classic (in addition to the Integrity Moments): These supplementary modules tend to deal with topics of an overarching nature and are less process-related, i.e. managers do not require any special prior knowledge of the subject. In this conventional approach, managers conduct a dialog with their employees at an in-person event or virtually. Optionally, managers can be trained/informed in advance by the compliance organization in a management briefing. The decision on how the Integrity Dialog is held (only Integrity Moments or in combination with a conventional module or modules) is the responsibility of the local CEOs with the support of the Country Compliance Officer and is adopted once a year in the CRB. Its focus should be on the message conveyed in the tone from the top/middle. There is no obligation to document in detail the employees who take part in the Integrity Dialog letters of invitation, minutes of meetings, etc., can be used as supporting evidence. A distinction is made between global mandatory, local mandatory and optional training products. The available training products, along with the global target group definition/recommendation and whether they are mandatory, are summarized in this overview below. Global mandatory training must be rolled out worldwide to a uniformly defined target group. That applies to online training and ILT. The regulatory stipulations and obligation to furnish supporting evidence that a training topic has been dealt with are always the basis for defining whether the training is a global mandatory measure. The time of regional rollout is defined by local management following advice by the Country Compliance Officer in coordination with the Regional Training Coordinator. The period of time in which the training must be completed is stated in the individual letter of invitation. From October 1, 2021, there will be one single target group for all globally mandatory training. This includes all employees with access to the SABA learning management system. In the period up to October 01, 2021, the target groups already defined and communicated will apply. In the case of local mandatory training , the country CEOs are responsible for specifying that an available training product is mandatory based on the recommendation by the Country Compliance Officer. The basis for that should be a regional risk assessment. The Compliance Officer is also given global recommendations on the target group as guidance for this training and they are documented in the learning management system My Learning (SABA) to ensure that regulatory requirements to provide supporting evidence are met. In individual cases (such as Export Control Basic Training), a training topic may be mandatory, but its content must be adapted locally to reflect the regional regulations and risk assessment. The Country Compliance Officer (in the case of EX in coordination with the EX business partner) is responsible for defining and controlling the content . The individual employee decides whether to take part in all other training measures, i.e. they are optional. Here, too, there are by and large recommendations on the target groups as guidance. Optional training can be undertaken using SABA or the integrated learning platform My Learning World and is documented in the respective systems. The global target group defined differs depending on the subject matter of the training measure and its definition is adapted and made available every year. From October 1, 2021, there will be one single target group for all globally mandatory training. This includes all employees with access to the SABA learning management system. In the period up to October 01, 2021, the target groups already defined and communicated will apply. For better orientation, there will be target group recommendations for learning offerings from October 01, 2021 (curriculum). The Siemens Business Conduct Guidelines (BCG) set forth the fundamental principles and rules governing how all employees must act within the Company Units and in relation to customers, external partners, and the general public. Accordingly, the web-based training Our BCG – Our Core represents basic training across all compliance fields of activity and is mandatory for all Siemens employees. If employees do not have access to SABA, the content must be conveyed by the regional compliance organization in the form of in-person training. That must likewise be documented in SABA with the aid of the Regional Training Coordinators. Further basic trainings ( essentials) available specifically for the Activity Fields are usually rolled out to the vast majority of employees who have access to SABA. That does not include employees who work in processing (e.g. in the job family Manufacturing). There are also training measures that are designed on the basis of specific risks and rolled out for what are termed", "metadata": "1. Training-2"}
{"text": "sensitive functions. The target group for this compliance training may vary depending on the topic and is defined for specific specialized training by the CTCircle Core Team in cooperation with the specialist department to reflect requirements. This applies to WBT and ILT. It is necessary to examine and define – at the country level and on the basis of statutory stipulations – the extent to which external employees (with an e-mail address …ext@siemens.com) are required to undergo training. They are currently not included in SABA and must be connected to the system in a separate process. That is done through the RTCs. If it is legally necessary at the regional level for external employees to be included in the training measures, the costs of that are borne centrally. Apart from that, the countries bear the costs of training external employees voluntarily. The CTCircle Core Team must be involved before external employees are activated in SABA. If a local Siemens company is provided with temporary staff or workers by an employment agency or another business partner, the CTCircle advises treating them as internal employees as regards training. That means these temporary workers should take part in the global and (if available) local mandatory training. If the temporary employees do not take part in the mandatory training as internal employees do, there must be appropriate supervision of the employment agency or business partner providing the temporary staff or workers. Employees at subsidiaries and acquisitions who do not (yet) have an entry in SCD/CHCM should be connected to SABA within three months by means of a manual workaround process so as to meet their training obligations. To enable that, a specific curriculum has been created in SABA and comprises the basic WBT measures (Our BCG-Our Core, Antitrust Essentials, Data Privacy Essentials, and Export Control & Customs Global Awareness). ILT measures are held after the employees have been integrated in the HR systems (in particular SCD, CHCM). The requirements for compliance training at companies in which Siemens has a minority stake are defined in Chapter H.6. It may be necessary for various reasons (such as a CRA decision, remediation measure or local legislation) to include additional participants or participant groups individually in one or more training measures. There may be multiple reasons for expansion of the target group the decision to do so lies with local management following consultation with the responsible Compliance Officer and should be documented transparently. A reduction in the minimum global target group is only possible on an individual basis (i.e. not on the basis of individual sub-job families or position types). The reasons for removal from the target group must be documented transparently (e.g. by the RTC). Such deactivations must be reviewed after a reasonable period of time and reversed if necessary. If SABA is used, all the relevant participants are selected automatically in accordance with global, binding minimum requirements. Manual action, such as a general query process at the operating units or through the HR organization, is not usually required and should be avoided. The data sources are the HR systems SCD and CHCM and the entries in it. If replies are received to invitations as a result of incorrect coding in SCD/CHCM, it is the task and responsibility of the respective operating units, and not of the compliance organization, to initiate appropriate corrections in SCD/CHCM through the local HR organization. If units are not (yet) connected to SCD/CHCM or no (sub-)job families and/or position types have been specified, the above instructions on identifying the target group must be implemented analogously. A manual transitional process for activating employees in the system is available for that (see Chapt. J. 1.2.3.3.3). The CTCircle Core must be contacted here if necessary. The subject of training must be discussed in the CRB once a year, no matter in which quarter. The rolling two-year Training Roadmap must be discussed and adopted at the (lead) country level. It contains the global and local mandatory training measures (including Integrity Dialog measures) and the status of the training measures for the past 12 months. The global training measures must be presented at the business level. If the business-related CRBs reveal training requirements, the competent Country Compliance Officers must be notified so that they can be reflected in the Training Roadmap. That requires early coordination between the business and regional managers. Decisions on adapting the Training Roadmap during the year must be made at the next CRB meeting. The country units are obligated to draw up and implement a Compliance Training Roadmap covering all the regional training activities for which the respective Compliance Officer is responsible. If necessary, subordinate assigned countries may receive instructions on region-specific training measures from their superior country units. Adaptations at the level of the respective company unit are possible, but they must", "metadata": "1. Training-3"}
{"text": "be agreed with the competent Compliance Officers at the regional level. A separate Training Roadmap does not have to be drawn up at the business level. From October 01, 2021, the globally mandatory training measures will be rolled out centrally to all employees (see Chapt. J.1.2.3.1). Only mandatory measures going beyond this and defined on the basis of local risks are to be decided at local level. No separate training roadmap is specified for this purpose. The responsible Country Compliance Officer identifies the training measures that are defined as global mandatory measures in the Compliance Training Landscape (see Chapt. J. 1.2.2.1.). The competent Country Compliance Officer evaluates the requirement for additional mandatory measures on the basis of local regulations and risk assessments. He/she bases that evaluation on the local risk potential, local statutory requirements, the country or company risk scores, and other factors (such as requirements pursuant to local or business-related remediation measures, ERM risks, etc.). He/she can choose the training measures from the portfolio of local mandatory measures (see Chapt. J. 1.2.2.2.). That also includes defining the relevant Integrity Dialog measures. There may be adjustments from local adaptation of training materials (see Chapt. J. 1.2.7.5). Additional requirements for specific local training products must be qualified together with the CTCircle Core Team before the regional Training Roadmap is agreed. The Training Roadmap has the following content: (1) Time frame (period of validity) of the Training Roadmap (2) Training plan, including a timeline, covering the global mandatory and the defined local mandatory training measures, as well as the proposed expansions and additional measures. The following details must be specified for every training measure contained in the training plan: topic, format (WBT/ILT), target group, training obligation (mandatory or optional), duration, implementation period (3) Additional documents if required, such as detailed information on training measures, reasons for adaptation or expansion, expectations from implementing the measures, procedure for handling incomplete training measures. There is no binding template for the Training Roadmap. However, the CTCircle provides an overview of the global and local mandatory training measures for the planning period. The final Training Roadmap agreed in the CRB defines the binding framework for holding compliance training measures at the country level. The Country Compliance Officer monitors implementation of the Training Roadmap on a regular basis (at least once a year). The (Lead) Country Compliance Officers must keep documentation on the Training Roadmap and the CRB approval. All mandatory Compliance training measures must be documented in SABA. The training history is documented and stored in SABA for ten years as of when a training measure is completed by an individual employee or as of migration from the former learning management system (LMS). Various structures and processes have been defined to ensure smooth processes. All WBT and ILT measures on the subject of compliance must be administered without exception in SABA, which is operated by the Global Learning World (HR GLW). Exceptions to obligatory use of SABA are permissible only if the conditions for using it have not been fulfilled due to the fact it has been rejected by the competent body/authority or bodies/authorities. In such a case, the CTCircle Core Team must be involved immediately. Where necessary and not already done, the local compliance organization ensures in good time that all the necessary conditions for using SABA are fulfilled and provides regional coordinators (RTCs) to organize and coordinate the training. They receive the necessary system permissions from the CTCircle Core Team in close coordination with HR GLW and are trained in using SABA. If a rollout is needed, the responsible RTC, if applicable with the further involvement of the Global SABA Support Team (function mailbox), must be contacted. All mandatory training measures have usually been presented to the Continuing Education and Training Committee of the Central Works Council and approved by the Central Works Council and in some cases by the Group Works Council. Nevertheless, the Compliance Officer is requested – before the training measures (global and local mandatory training) are implemented – to examine whether there is an obligation to obtain approval from or notify public authorities or other bodies (such as a codetermination body) under statutory or other regulations. If so, the Country Compliance Officer must ensure that the relevant approval is obtained and/or the responsible authority/body is notified before the training measure is used. If a training measure cannot be held due to the fact that approval for it has been not been given despite being applied for, the CTCircle Core Team must be notified immediately. All the materials/modules required for holding centrally provided training are designed by the CTCircle in coordination with the respective topic owners or the Compliance Legal unit and made available worldwide on the Compliance Marketplace.

In the case of carve-outs, the rights to use WBT and ILT measures must be governed by license agreements with the holders of the rights. LC C GF must be contacted in this regard. The materials for the ILT are provided by the CTCircle at least in English and mostly also in German, while those for the WBT are provided in further languages to differing extents (complete new version or with subtitles). The following applies to ILT: The local compliance organization must have the materials translated into further languages. The local compliance organization is responsible for ensuring that - The materials are translated correctly from English/German - The English/German templates are fully translated into the new language - The final version is approved by a qualified person (such as a local legal counsel). The following applies to WBT: Further languages are defined by the training projects to reflect needs and with regard to keeping costs down, subject to the approval of the CTCircle Core Team. The translations are coordinated by the project teams and agreed with the local compliance organization. If a mandatory training product is not available in the required language, another format may be chosen locally (e.g. recorded ILT) to meet the training requirements. This is to be documented by the RTCs via the correspondingly provided alternative products (containers) in SABA. If further local translations/adaptations are necessary, the local compliance organization is responsible for ensuring the training materials are correct afterwards and also bears the costs for them. Specific adaptation of the materials by the local compliance organization is possible subject to the following conditions: - The adaptation focuses on local or organizational matters, such as local compliance guidelines - The additional slides/topics are within reasonable limits - The local compliance organization itself is responsible for creating additional slides and their content, which must be approved in advance by a qualified person (such as a local legal counsel). - Fundamental adaptations to content must be approved by the CTCircle Core Team, if required with the involvement of the specialist departments (e.g. LC M&A CMP for antitrust) ILT measures are held by trainers from the compliance organization. In the case of training related to data privacy, colleagues who deal with data privacy issues can also be entrusted with designing and holding the training subject to mutual agreement. In the case of training on antitrust and competition law, colleagues from LC M&A CMP (such as regional antitrust experts (RAEs), can also be integrated as trainers. In general, it is necessary to ensure that all the nominated and used trainers are adequately qualified in terms of presentation/moderation techniques and also have sound, detailed knowledge of the compliance issues. That is the task and responsibility of the respective compliance organization and the competent RTCs. The invitations/reminders are e-mailed automatically by SABA to participants as soon as one of the following conditions has been met: 1. The employee is a member of the target group that has been bindingly defined worldwide and has not been deactivated in SABA by SCD/CHCM or the local compliance organization and has not previously taken part in the training in question 2. The employee has additionally been nominated by the local compliance organization or his/her manager and activated manually and has not previously taken part in the training in question. Employees who are not (yet) connected to the HR systems (esp. SCD, CHCM) should be connected to SABA within three months via a manual workaround process in order to gain access to the essential, mandatory training (see Chapt. J. 1.2.3.3.3). New employees in functions with Compliance relevant risk profiles must be invited to mandatory trainings within three months or at the next possible opportunity (max. six months). All letters of invitation and reminders are drawn up in the defined languages and have a uniform layout and text worldwide.

The letters of invitation/reminders contain a reference to that effect, as well as a link to the current contact persons and participant support team at Global Learning World (HR GLW). In general, it is the task of the RTCs and responsibility of the competent Country Compliance Officers to identify overdue participants (if the deadline for completing the training has been exceeded) and initiate suitable measures to follow up on the training", "metadata": "1.

{"text": "participants. Implementation of an escalation model at the local level is recommended. That can be used, for example, to define additional necessary actions (such as individual communication measures, involvement of the person's manager). In the case of training measures relating to data privacy or export control, the colleagues responsible for these topics might explicitly be involved responsibility for that must be agreed on at the local level in good time. From 01 October 2021, the manual follow-up will be replaced by an automated escalation process. Until then, the open follow-ups are to be closed as far as possible. Every participant is sent a certificate that can be downloaded from SABA after successfully completing the training. All the certificates are created with a uniform layout and text worldwide and in the defined languages. Customized texts/supplements are not permitted. The sole signatory is the CCO (Chief Compliance Officer) of Siemens. In addition, successful participation in all global mandatory training products that are administered in SABA is reported automatically to Workday. Regular analyses of feedback on training is in principle essential to maintain a functioning quality assurance process. If SABA is used, a feedback questionnaire is sent out by the system together with the letter containing the certificate. The global Compliance training products are hosted by LC C GF TR (see Chapt. J. 1.2.2). Depending on the urgency, content feedback and necessary technical adjustments are implemented immediately or bundled. This happens in alignment with the departments responsible for the content (content owners). In addition, the content owners are asked once a year to review the global training content to ensure that it is up to date. Both activities are documented centrally. The accuracy and completeness of local training content must be ensured by the Country Compliance Officer (see Chapt. J. 1.2.2.2). This must be checked annually and documented locally in an appropriate manner. 1. The onboarding of new employees in the Compliance organization is supported by a variety of centrally provided web-based training courses, recorded training sessions and on-the-job training, which are summarized in the onboarding checklist. The onboarding checklist ensures that Compliance professionals are trained in the specific activity fields, including the legal framework, and are given an overview of how to use the relevant tools. In addition, the buddy concept provides a contact person who is available to answer questions and support the onboarding process. This person is to be appointed by the responsible manager. Apart from the provision of self-study material, the onboarding is being supported by the two-step Compliance Education Program (CEP). Export Control employees will also be required to update their expertise via the EX-Brush-up training on a regular basis, i.e. at least every 2 years. The two-stage program gives new compliance employees an introduction to and relevant know-how about the organization, regulations and processes of the Siemens compliance organization. The program also promotes global networking among compliance employees by means of pinpointed activities. It is mandatory for new employees in the roles of Compliance Officers and Compliance Experts at Siemens AG and affiliated companies. Participants are registered by their immediate manager with LC C GF, which organizes and implements the training. A virtual concept for the CEP was developed in the wake of the global COVID-19 pandemic as a temporary means of enabling the training measures to be continued by means of virtual methods. CEP 1 (in which employees participate within six months of joining the company) offers an overview of all compliance guidelines and processes, as well as the possibility of building a network with the compliance experts at Siemens' headquarters and with other participants. It is held as in-person training in Munich-Feldafing over five days or virtually over approximately three weeks. CEP 2 (in which employees participate 12 to 18 months after CEP 1) offers participants in-depth compliance know-how in the relevant fields of compliance and methodological knowledge (such as in agile working, communication methods), as well as the chance to share knowledge among compliance experts. For Export Control Business Partners who focus solely on export control functions, participation in CEP 2 training is optional. It is held as in-person training in Munich-Feldafing over five days or virtually over approximately three weeks. The EX Brush-up (for employees of the LC CO with an EX BP function, including EX BP deputies and team members with more than 2 to 3 years of experience) offers regular refresher training on export control regulations and on Siemens' internal export control processes, procedures and systems. Participants are nominated by the Export Control Business Partner in the local compliance organization. The training is currently being held virtually with a 2-week curriculum, with the learning units condensed into three half-days.

{"text": "The basic principles on data protection to be observed by all Siemens employees are listed in the Chapter Data Privacy: Responsibility (Chapter Part 1 D.1.). This Chapter compiles the special obligations for data deletion and retention that must be observed by Compliance employees in the context of Compliance Case Handling , as well as Discipline and Remediation. In this context, it is important to take into account the particular tension between obligations regarding retention periods imposed by authorities or by law on the one hand, and the obligation for data economy and, above all, deletion on the other. What every Compliance employee must know: - Personal data must be deleted (Chapter Part 3 L.8.2.) when the purpose for processing the data no longer exists, unless retention obligations or rights (Chapter Part 3 L.8.1.) exist (Art. 17 GDPR). - The purpose of processing personal data in Compliance Case Handling is to ensure a functioning Compliance system, depending on the date in the form of - the Case Handling, i.e., the investigation of allegations of possible Compliance violations (Chapter Part 3 L.2) - responding to such violations, including appropriate Disciplinary Measures (Chapter Part 3 L.4), - the Remediation of weaknesses in processes (Chapter Part 3 L.5), - the handling of information requests from authorities (Chapter Part 3 L.7.1.), - the fulfillment of legal requirements (e.g. disclosure obligations, searches) (Chapter Part 3 L.7.1.) or - the pursuit of damage claims or other consequential issues (e.g. financial or tax implications). Insofar as no deviating regulations on data retention for Compliance Case Handling apply, the Siemens Guideline on retention obligations and periods (Leitfaden zu Aufbewahrungspflichten und -fristen - only available in German) apply. In particular, in the context of Compliance Case Handling, the statutory retention obligations (Chapter L.8.1.1.) and the retention rights in Siemens' own interest (Chapter L.8.1.2.) must be observed. Of particular interest in Compliance Case Handling are the retention obligations for lawyersfiles ( individual German statutory retention obligations (.) and the applicable national statutory retention obligations (.). According to German law , a lawyer shall retain files for 6 years after the end of the calendar year, in which he/she has brought a case to a conclusion, in order to be able to give an orderly account of his professional work. Files include - riginals or copies of documents received for or on behalf of the client on grounds of lawyers' professional practice, - correspondence between the lawyer and the client and/or - any other document necessary to comprehend the case. This applies accordingly in as far as the lawyer uses electronic data processing in order to keep files, such as LIA , but it does not apply to data stored in other LC CO IR tools, such as FCMS /Recommind data. However, evidence extracted from FCMS/Recommind data becomes part of the file stored in LIA and thus of the lawyers' file, as far as such evidence is necessary to comprehend the case. According to the German Money Laundering Act (Geldwäschegesetz), there is a 5-year retention obligation for all data collected and information obtained in the course of fulfilling due diligence obligations . Under German Securities Trading Law (Wertpapierhandelsgesetz), there is a retention obligation of 5 years 8. According to the German Fiscal Code (Abgabenordnung) and the German Commercial Code (Handelsgesetzbuch), original invoices and underlying contractual and tax-related documents, i.e. in particular contracts with external lawyers, must be retained for 10 years 9. If the national law applicable in the specific case prescribes further retention periods, these must be observed separately. For details, please refer to the applicable national regulations and case law. A data retention right results from how long it is justified under data protection law, i.e. necessary for Siemens in the respective individual case, to take into account collected personal data in the context of a Compliance investigation ( or also with regard to imminent or pending damage claims, criminal or administrative fines proceedings (Chapter L.8.1.2.2.: Statutory Limitation Periods). A right of retention may arise in the course of a Compliance investigation. After a Compliance investigation has been initiated, LC CO IR may issue a Legal Hold (see Siemens Circular 226 Chapter 5.2.). This is an instruction to employees in the course of a Compliance investigation not to delete specified data (retention obligation). A further right to data retention in Compliance Case Handling arises due to imminent or pending damage claims and criminal or administrative fines proceedings. In this context, the applicable statutory periods of limitation must be taken into account, which justify further retention prior to their expiry. German Administrative and Criminal Law Depending on the exact allegations, the relevant statutory limitation period under German Administrative and Criminal Law is generally 6 months to 3 years and 3 to 5 years respectively after the offence has been completed. For", "metadata": "8. Data deletion and retention-1"}
{"text": "practicability reasons, we assume that the beginning of the limitation period in our Compliance cases is near to case closing. However, if a result constituting an element of the offence occurs later, the limitation period shall commence to run from that time . Such a result could occur several years following case closing (e.g. ongoing payment under long-term contracts obtained by fraudulent or corruptive means). German Tax Laws Limitation period under relevant German Tax Laws is 4 to 10 years . German Civil Law For civil damage claims under German Civil Law relevant limitation period is 3 years starting at the end of the year in which the claim arose up to 30 years in case of excusable lack of claimant's knowledge of the circumstances giving rise to the claim and the identity of the obligor . FCPA/UK Bribery Act Similar applies under FCPA provisions, especially in case of conspiracy , while under the U.K. Bribery Act there is no formal statute of limitations at all . German Stock Corporation Law Additionally, Siemens management can be held liable for damage caused by not having duly organized the Compliance procedures for a period of 10 years, with the burden of proof for having applied the necessary diligence lying upon them . Once the Compliance case or process is closed, the data is generally no longer required for the purpose for which it was collected or otherwise processed and must be deleted subject to the retention obligations and rights mentioned above (see Chapter L.8.1.), as well as other national regulations applicable in the specific case. Data deletion shall be observed at each and every step of the Compliance Case Handling process up to and including disciplinary measures and remediation. The deletion of all personal data takes place: - Immediately in the case of obviously abusive or unsubstantiated information as well as in the case of information which already after a rough examination turns out to be obviously unsubstantiated and are not based on sufficient grounds for suspicion. - After 4 months in the case of data collection requests (Part 3 Chapter L.2.4.5.). - After 5 years of all data in the case of Compliance with the retention obligations under the German Securities Trading Act . - After 6 years in the case of Clearance, Closure Reports and all other Compliance cases that were closed without Findings or Compliance cases that were closed as implausible or duplicate. - After 10 years in the case of Investigation Reports and all other compliance cases closed with Findings , and in the case of original invoices and underlying contractually and fiscally relevant documents (e.g. attorney compensation agreements, time sheets) , - After 15 years in the case of disciplinary proceedings and actions following Compliance investigations . The deletion period begins - for data collection orders, immediately after the lawyer closes the case, - therwise, after the end of the calendar year in which the lawyer closed the case, or - for original invoices and underlying contractual and tax-related documents, after the end of the calendar year in which the document was created, or - after the end of the year in which the disciplinary measure was imposed.

{"text": "\nUnder certain circumstances, Siemens may be held liable (B.1.) for the actions of certain third parties which we refer to as Business Partners. Before starting a concrete relationship with certain third parties, Siemens must take steps to create transparency and ensure that the relationship is responsibly evaluated and managed. A Compliance Due Diligence (CDD) (A.4.) has to be initiated in the CDD-Tool and certain contract provisions (A.6.) need to be included in a contract with them. After the approval of a CDD, an ongoing Business Partner relationship must be monitored by the respective Company Unit. The relevant CDD has to be kept up to date (A.4.2.). Please find as follows an overview of our internal Business Partner landscape: Certain business relationships require a Compliance Due Diligence (CDD) to be performed in the CDD-Tool. Generally, all Business Partners can be categorized as follows: Intermediaries - Sales-related Intermediaries , e.g. Sales Agents, Business Consultants (A.1.1.) - Non-sales related Intermediaries , incl. Lobbyists and Customs Agents (A.1.2.). Resellers with Red Flags - Value-add Reseller , e.g. EPC, OEM / System Integrator (A.1.3.2.) - Distributor / other Reseller (A.1.3.). For these Resellers, a CDD and the use of certain contract provisions is only mandatory in case of one of the following Red Flags : - The use of the specific Reseller is required by a third party, e.g. an end customer (A.1.3.1.1.) - The Reseller receives an unusual financial benefit or business term from Siemens (A.1.3.1.2.) - The Reseller places another third party between himself and his customer without plausible cause (A.1.3.1.3.) - There is currently relevant negative compliance related information (not settled or mitigated) about the Reseller from reliable source (A.1.3.1.4.). Cooperation/Consortium Partners (A.1.4.) Majority shareholdings of Siemens (= affiliated companies) and Siemens employees are not in scope. The identification of such Business Partners requiring a CDD is supported by the Business Partner Checklist in the CDD-Tool. A Sales related Intermediary is a third party which - facilitates the sale of Siemens goods, services and/or assets - to another third party without purchasing them and - receives a fee or other financial benefits (including price reductions) from Siemens for such service (e.g. Sales related Business Consultants or Sales Agent) - Sales related business consultant without sales rights Third party commissioned to assist Siemens to obtain sales or orders for defined specific business opportunities , often larger projects. A sales related Business Consultant assists Siemens in generating revenue potential through direct contact with the customer (e.g. by promoting projects or supporting the pre-acquisition phase). He usually receives a fee that is not success related and works in an advisory capacity without being accountable for the outcome of a consulting exercise (e.g. hired to facilitate introduction to customers or assist the sales function in other ways). A Consultant could also negotiate economical terms of a contract on behalf of Siemens. Purchasing contracts for the goods and services resulting from the consulting exercise are typically concluded between Siemens and the end customer directly. - Sales agent A Sales Agent is a person or company that arranges sales transactions as an independent contractor for an undefined number of business opportunities , on behalf of a Siemens entity as principal. Often in a defined territory or for a defined customer group, regarding contractually defined Siemens products or services (often also referred to as commercial agent or commercial broker). Sales Agents usually receive a commission from the principal for the business deal arranged and for projects based on separate agreed commission agreements. Sales Agents do not purchase and resell Siemens products and services (as opposed to Resellers) but represent the company in a certain region or towards certain customers. The purchasing contracts for the goods and services are typically concluded between Siemens and the end customer directly (also see SC 140 Regional sales activities - Representation rights and sales rights). Please keep in mind that Strategy (ST TO) is responsible for the preparation and conclusion of contracts between sales agents / distributors and Siemens AG allocating representation rights / sales rights to third parties to ensure that sales rights granted to the Business Partner do not overlap with those granted to other sales agents. Introducer are Business Partner of Siemens Financial Services (SFS) to which SFS Implementing Rule (only accessible for SFS employees) applies. Please refer to A.8. A regular Non-sales related Intermediary is a third party which - facilitates a non-sales related decision or conduct (e.g. the issuance or award of an approval, permit, license or visa, a technical certification, or the payment of a debt) - of another third party to the benefit of Siemens and - receives a fee or other financial benefits (including price reductions) from Siemens for such service .

A Reseller is a third-party who is planned to be contracted to purchase goods, services and/or other assets from Siemens and to resell or lease them to other third-parties on its own account. A Distributor is a Reseller who resells Siemens products, services and/or other assets via his/her sales channels, or directly to multiple end customers without further assembly, technical modifications or additions. Resellers and distributors are only in scope under certain conditions: Reseller and Distributors are only in scope if they have at least one Red Flag. Value-add-resellers are only in scope if they have at least one red flag and involvement of recognizable Siemens product (Details can be found in section A.1.3.2.) Red Flags are any circumstances that may indicate a risk regarding the Business Partner's integrity. Any commercial, financial, legal or ethical irregularity can be a Red Flag. The existence of a Red Flag does not preclude business but makes it necessary to review the Business Partner via a CDD. If Resellers additionally fulfill criteria of a Sales related Intermediary or Cooperation/Consortium Partner (e.g. in case of combined agency / distributorship agreements), they are automatically in scope notwithstanding any red flags. In unclear cases, please contact your Compliance Officer. The results of such consultation and decision shall be documented accordingly. Please also keep in mind to check the need for an AML Due Diligence and that certain competition law requirements must be met in dual distribution situations (more details can be found in the LC intranet). Examples for Red Flags - The use of the specific Reseller is required by a third party , e.g. an end customer (A. 1.3.1.1.) - The Reseller receives an unusual financial benefit or business term from Siemens (A.1.3.1.2.) - The Reseller places another third party between himself and his customer without plausible cause (A.1.3.1.3.) - There is currently relevant negative compliance related information (not settled or mitigated) about the Reseller from reliable source (A.1.3.1.4.). A third party (e.g. end customer) might require a Reseller in bad faith for fostering problematic purposes on behalf or to the benefit of the third party or persons within the third party and/or the Reseller. This Reseller might create a pool of money (e.g. by overcharging) colluding with the third party or its employees which could be misused for problematic purposes, e.g. for bribery or kickbacks. In most cases the third party is a representative of the end customer or another decision-making authority involved in the business case. The required specific Reseller could be critical if: - The reasons for requiring a Reseller are not plausible and/or transparent because of missing commercial, technical or legal justification - Indications are available that key persons or key employees within the required Reseller have close personal ties to the decision maker or end customer or are even the same persons represented in both companies - The required Reseller has no obvious references, track record or experience in the respective field or country of activities - A Reseller who has not been mentioned in ongoing contract negotiations between Siemens and the end customer is suddenly introduced by the third party (e.g. the end customer) as the required new contractual partner. It is not uncommon that Siemens supports Resellers to promote Siemens' products and services by targeted sales and marketing activities. In addition, sometimes Siemens might reimburse warehousing expenses to its Resellers to ensure adequate stock level for the indirect channel or might give a start-up financing reimbursing costs for promotion and merchandizing. In many cases, these reimbursements are part of an established partner program. Instead of an actual reimbursement, special investments by the Reseller (in e.g. marketing activities, sales competency, stock excellency) might also be measured based on predefined targets and then financially rewarded in form of an incentive scheme, all of which is documented", "metadata": "4. Cooperation with Business Partners-2"}
{"text": "in a partner agreement. On the other hand, it can be a danger sign for corruption if unusual financial benefits or unusual business terms are agreed with a Reseller. The Reseller might create a pool of money e.g. claiming inflated contractual penalties or passing on financial benefits which could be misused for problematic purposes, e.g. for bribery. To identify an unusual nature it is important to assess first what usual means. This could be done by using examples from similar constellations in the relevant market or country. Also, the Siemens price lists and standard business terms should be considered. Then a comparison with the actual business case is needed to identify gaps (and possible tolerable reasons for these). The pure facts, that a payment was made or a business term was used for several times, does not automatically imply an usual character of that payment or business term. Unfortunately, no fixed rules can be provided regarding the result of the comparison between a usual and the constellation of the concrete business case to find out if it is still usual or already unusual. Therefore, a case by case evaluation is necessary. Examples regarding the usual or unusual character of a financial benefit: - A financial benefit may be usual if it is a part of a partner program or one-time marketing activity and if it is transparently calculated, accessible to many partners, openly communicated and part of a written agreement - A financial benefit may be unusual if it is requested from Siemens by the Reseller to receive such benefits exclusively and without a transparent target setting. And of course, the amount is of essence. Unusual business terms differ often clearly from Siemensgeneral terms and conditions: - Extended or uncommon contractual penalties - Extended warranties - Very high discounts without product strategic rationale - Actual scope and adequacy of prices of services (e.g. assembly, maintenance) cannot be determined - Low or no down payments in project business - Very long or unwarranted payment terms. ! The involvement of an additional third party (e.g. an additional reseller or an intermediary) between our contractual Reseller and the end customer without a comprehensible reason is a danger sign. This constellation decreases transparency and might be misused for problematic purposes. The additional third party might create a pool of money e.g. by a collusive overcharging which could be misused for problematic purposes, e.g. for bribery or kickbacks. The following examples indicate a missing plausible cause: - Circumvention of tax or foreign exchange regulations: Our Reseller might involve a further third party to circumvent potentially the tax or foreign exchange regulations. Often jurisdictions with the character of a tax haven are involved. - Disguised identity of the additional third party: Our Reseller might use an additional third party with the intention to camouflage the identity of the person or company potentially critically profiting of the business activity (e.g. via the additional third party acting as a straw man or a dummy). It might also be the case that the unknown person or company uses the money he gains for critical purposes, e.g. bribery or kick back. - Price inflation: The final price charged to the end-customer gets unnaturally inflated using additional third party, which increases the risk that money is channeled out of the value chain for critical purposes. - Money laundering: The payment contractually owed to Siemens by our Reseller is announced to be transferred from the additional third party. ! There might be currently negative Compliance related information about the Reseller itself or its key employees, for example: - Current accusations or criminal proceedings (not settled or mitigated) - Unsolved or ongoing compliance cases - Close ties to a decision maker at the (end)customer - Payments from a third country - Management Judgment , i.e. a request from Business Management or responsible Compliance Officer to perform a Due Diligence on this Reseller, e.g. based on suspicions on potential problematic activities or lack of integrity of the Reseller - Other currently relevant negative Compliance related information (not settled or mitigated) about the Business Partner from reliable source . ! A Value-Add Reseller (e.g. EPC / OEM / System Integrator) is a Reseller who further assembles, technically modifies or makes additions to a Siemens product. A Value-Add Reseller is only in scope if the Siemens product remains recognizable as such, that means that it forms a major part of the newly created product of the Reseller (e.g. a large Siemens turbine in a power plant). This will usually be the case when: 1. The value of the Siemens product in relation to the total volume is greater than 20%. 2. The decision of the end customer to purchase the product is essentially based on the fact that a Siemens product is included. A Value-Add Reseller", "metadata": "4. Cooperation with Business Partners-3"}
{"text": "is not in scope if the Siemens product only forms a minor part (e.g. a Siemens fire detection system in a building). Please note: In case an Value-Add Reseller shows massive negative information , it is strongly recommended , also regardless of the above mentioned requirements, to create a CDD to be able to monitor the Value-Add Reseller during the business relationship. The responsible Compliance officer should consult with the colleagues from LC CO RFC LF / PT in each individual case. - Leasing company An End Customer request to use a leasing company is no Red Flag since it is normal business conduct that end customer decides to lease instead of purchasing a product. - Group of companies / purchasing companies A Reseller belonging to the same group of companies as the end customer is not considered as Business Partner. This also applies to state-controlled companies which are reselling to an end customer also controlled by that state. However, other purchasing companies remain in scope. A Cooperation/Consortium Partner is a third party with whom Siemens - plans to collaborate to achieve a sales related common goal and - is jointly and severally liable towards the customer for the scope of the contract (e.g. a partner in a Consortium, Arbeitsgemeinschaft or ARGE , Unión Temporal de Empresas or UTE , Groupement Momentané d'Entreprises or GME ) A Cooperation/Consortium is usually based on an arrangement in which several firms (from the same or different industry sectors or countries) to pool their technical, financial and human resources. - In an open consortium all members of the consortium, i.e. Siemens and its consortium partner(s) enter into a contract with the customer and all consortium members are jointly and severally liable towards the customer for the performance of the contract. In case Siemens enters into an open consortium a CDD must be conducted for all consortium partner(s). The same applies for all other agreements with joint and several liabilities irrespective of the title of the agreement (e.g. Teaming Agreements , Three Party Agreements etc.). - In a silent consortium the contract with the customer is only concluded between the customer and one of the companies and only that company is liable towards the customer for the performance of the contract. For silent consortium partners, generally no CDD is required. This is only necessary if they also fall into another category (e.g. as resellers, non-sales related intermediaries, suppliers etc.). In such cases, the respective processes must be followed. However, please note that not only the contractual agreement is decisive, but all actual circumstances must be considered. The following constellations of cooperation/consortia are excluded from the scope: - Consortium partners (including the consortium leader) which participate in a bank lending consortium together with a Siemens finance company as well as any bank or other third party which perform typical functions in a financing provided by a lenders' consortium (e.g. Facility Agent, Security Trustee, Paying Agent, Technical Agent) are out of scope. - Silent Consortium Partners do not require a CDD if they do not perform additionally a task which is in scope of Circular No. 226, e.g. as a sales agent (see above ). - Joint Venture Partners aresubject to Circular No. 222: Application for and approval of capital investments and divestments . If, however, they perform additionally a task, e.g. as a sales agent, they are in scope. For the company units Digital Industries (DI), Smart Infrastructure (SI) and Siemens Mobility (SMO), a Business Partner Strategy must be defined by the respective management based on a mandatory Business Partner portfolio and strategy statement. The selection of Business Partners must be in line with this strategy. On an annual basis the Business Partner portfolio and strategy review is reviewed by the responsible CEO of the Siemens unit, supported by Compliance. Details can be found in the document Further details onBusiness Partner portfolio and strategy review can be found in The use of subcontractors or further resellers is subject to the condition that the Business Partner obliges the subcontractor/further reseller to comply with compliance provisions equivalent to those in the contract between Siemens and the Business Partner. It is not required that the Business Partner includes exactly or even similar clauses to the Binding Contract Provisions since Siemens' influence on the concrete terms of a contractual agreement between third parties is limited. However, as a minimum, the Business Partner must oblige its subcontractors or further resellers to comply with all applicable laws and regulations, in particular to any laws and regulations relating to anti-corruption, anti-money laundering and antitrust. For specific Business Partner types, please note the following : Intermediaries: Where an Intermediary intends to use a subcontractor for the services agreed with Siemens, an approval by Siemens is required, provided that such subcontractor would be in scope", "metadata": "4. Cooperation with Business Partners-4"}
{"text": "of if he would be retained by Siemens directly. Reseller : A Reseller must notify Siemens if he intends to resell the goods to a party other than the end customer. If the Company Unit is notified by the Business Partner after the conclusion of the contract that it intends to use a new or other subcontractor or further reseller, for medium and high risk CDDs the CDD Responsible has to update the CDD. Where a red flag is identified in relation to any subcontractor/further reseller of a Business Partner, the same action must be taken as if the red flag had occurred regarding the Business Partner himself. A valid and approved CDD is a prerequisite for cooperating with Business Partners. Only the may be used for this. Details are explained in The Compliance Due Diligence process ( CDD Process ) supports conducting a risk- based integrity check of Business Partners. The aim is to ensure that all Business Partner engagements are based upon a transparent overview of the planned relationship and that this relationship is continuously and effectively monitored. The Siemens Company Unit who would like to engage a Business Partner is responsible for starting a CDD in the . The steps of a CDD are as follows: ! Specific Approval Contracts with business partners assigned to the risk category high risk , have to be approved by the CEO / Head of a Business Company , Regional Company or Corporate Function prior to the contract signature. Responsible for informing are both the CDD Responsible and the approving manager. Please note : If a CDD serves for more than one Division or Business Unit, the biggest user principle applies. The Division (or Business Unit) must be selected that is having or is planned to have the biggest business volume with the Business Partner. This principle avoids that CDDs are assigned to - performed on ARE level - or - performed on division level - which causes intransparency. If you are unsure about the correct assignment, please contact your Compliance Officer. For further details of the CDD process, please see chapter Approval of the CDD does not mean that all corruption risks can be excluded. Accordingly, once the CDD has been approved the Siemens unit dealing with the Business Partner must stay in close contact with the Business Partner and be alert and vigilant to any danger signs pointing to a risk of corruption which may appear in the course of the business relationship. The Update Process in combination with the existing Business Partner portfolio reviews of CDDs in Compliance Review Boards and management meetings supports the ongoing monitoring of Business Partner relationships. Business awareness The business unit is aware of its responsibility for its Business Partners. This awareness can for example be expressed by clear tone from the top message by the CEO to the respective entities, or simply by the fact that relationships to Business Partners are regularly discussed in business meetings, Compliance Review Boards or corresponding meetings. Regular assessments The need for the relationship and the performance in consideration of the compensation is reassessed on a regular basis. Especially if the engaging Siemens entity is not located in the country but another Siemens entity is, there must be clear and transparent evidence why the relevant services cannot be provided by the Siemens organization. If a Business Partner acts as a door opener , for example due to his unique technical experience or market knowledge, the engagement should only be temporary until the targets of the engagement are fulfilled or until the door is open and the knowledge about a market or a technology has been built up in Siemens. Especially for Distributors and Sales related Intermediaries, it is recommended to visit them before the engagement is started. An assessment on a regular basis whether the Business Partner provides the services and that the compensation, rebates or any other benefits (in line with local law) are in proportion to these services is part of any common business behavior. Warning signs are taken seriously Potential warning signs in the relationship need to be taken seriously and properly addressed. Red flags can, for example, be: - A suspicion of a breach of the compliance provisions in the contract with the Business Partner e.g.: chapter compensation and expense reimbursement (e.g. the partner insists on being paid in cash in departure from the contractual agreements or issues false invoices or other false documentation, or makes suspicious statements in conversations which may be indicative of corrupt activities, e.g. that he needs financial or other support for accommodating the demands of a friend employed at the end customer). - Credible information about the Business Partner which indicates non-compliance with laws, contract regulations or other rules and procedures regarding the integrity of the Business Partner.", "metadata": "4. Cooperation with Business Partners-5"}
{"text": "- A merger or acquisition which has influence on the Business Partner directly or indirectly, if there is a justified suspicion about Compliance issues at the acquired company. - A change in management which creates doubts about the integrity of the Business Partner, e.g. if a close government connection or a reputation for corruption of the new management are known. Measures to be taken The Siemens unit must take appropriate steps – in cooperation with the General Counsel and the Compliance Officer – to eliminate corruption risks, for example: - to update the CDD - to seek clarification from the Business Partner - to decide to conduct an audit in consultation with Legal, Controlling and Finance Audit (CF A) and the Compliance Officer - to adjust the contract conditions (if this would constitute a viable remedy to a risk identified) - to terminate the business relationship (i.e. if there is no other way of remedying the corruption risk identified) - to disapprove the CDD. It is possible to centrally disapprove a CDD or the Business Partner by the Compliance Officer (see chapter  - to restrict the CDD approval, e.g. to a particular payment. Regular discussion of high-risk relationships Relationships with the highest risk are discussed regularly e.g. in the Compliance Review Board meetings. The risk level determined in the should not be decisive, but one indication. Further criteria, either solely or combined, should be considered to focus on business relationships with highest risk, like - sales related higher risk due diligences for natural persons - due diligences for Business Partners located or performing services in countries with a high corruption index - Business Partners located or providing services in a country outside of the country of the respective Siemens entity or in a country where Siemens is not represented - due diligences with adverse but not proven information (e.g. negative press reports) - business relationships where different third parties are involved in the value chain, e.g. sub-distributors, subcontractors especially where the customer is located in a country with a high corruption risk - Business Partners that receive a considerable compensation for their services, especially if the compensation is a success fee - sales related business relationships where the Business Partner is engaged in the tender phase with a governmental customer especially in countries with a high corruption risk. The can be used by Compliance Officers to identify such CDDs. A Regular (mandatory) update of a CDD will be due every three years. A limited number of questions have to be re-answered and are marked in the : - Low risk: updated integrity search - Medium risk: as low risk plus a new version of the independent background report (Dun and Bradstreet) to be obtained and reviewed - High risk: as for low/medium plus update of organizational setup (Extended Key Data and group structure) and integrity checks (SETIS/internet and Involvement of Key Persons in litigations) The CDD Responsible will be automatically informed by an email notification to start an Update of a CDD and the approval process is based on the significance of changes. No significant changes: only sign-off by the CDD Responsible, with the Management Approver and CO Reviewer informed of the changes via email. They may raise questions and request further information if deemed necessary. Significant changes: a new Management Approval and CO Review is required with the CO Reviewer responsible to involve further stakeholders like CO or CMC if deemed necessary. Only an increase of the risk level requires a Compliance approval. The will automatically determine the relevant approval process.

Introducers (Product category Brokerage of financing) According to SFS COF's I an Introducer is a third party business partner of the SFS Business Unit COF who is introducing a finance transaction as Vendor or Broker . - Vendors are typically the equipment suppliers whose products are financed by SFS COF. There are two subtypes: Manufacturers and Resellers incl. Distributors . The additional requirement of a Red Flag / Threshold is based on the comparably lower compliance risk of the financing of the sale of products which is merely an annex to the main business activity of the Vendor. The vendor's goal is to sell its own product to an end customer, whereby SFS COF only provides the financing to facilitate the Vendors customers use of the asset. - Brokers typically facilitate business opportunities of SFS COF by introducing SFS financing to third party equipment suppliers or their customers. There are three subtypes: Traditional Brokers, Assignors and Other Brokers. The additional requirement of a Red Flag / Threshold is based on the comparably lower compliance risk of the broker market versus the product market. In the broker market the business success of a broker is based exclusively on the good financing conditions he can offer his customer. As the financing rate / interest is the key factor in the customers considerations, the risk of bribes to the customer to accepts SFS financing over another financing with better condition is low. Remarketing Partners (Product category remarketing of used Siemens owned assets) Remarketing Partners act as brokers on behalf of SFS in sale of used leasing assets owned by SFS or other used assets that SFS can claim title to in event of customer default during a finance contract.

Siemens may be held accountable for the actions of a Business Partner from a legal and a reputational point of view. Working with a potentially corrupt Business Partner, therefore, creates a significant risk for Siemens. The OECD-Report on identifies multiple jurisdictions in which a company can be held liable for the actions of its Business Partners (see ) and outlines possible consequences for companies, such as debarment from public tenders (see ). On the other hand, the OECD Report also shows that the existence of an effective compliance system not only has a preventive function, but it also serves to mitigate sanctions in some jurisdictions (see ). In general, the legal risk depends on the legal landscape of the respective jurisdiction. However, there are jurisdictions where very limited or no connection to the country is needed to have local consequences for the acts of a corrupt Business Partner (see ). German law distinguishes between offences affecting public officials (e.g. Sec. 331-334 StGB - ) and those which affect fair competition (e.g. Sec. 298, 299 StGB). Sec. 11 StGB determines who is a public official (if necessary, in conjunction with Sec. 335a StGB). In the sense of Sec. 331 et seq. StGB corruption can be committed: - In active form (demand, offer and promise of a benefit, granting of an (undue) advantage, bribery, kickback payments) - In passive form (accepting of an (undue) advantage, bribability) In the case of accepting an advantage (Sec. 331 StGB) the public official accepts an advantage for which he has no legal claim as an equivalent for his or her duties. The official act does not have to be illegal. The granting of such an advantage is punishable by Sec. 333 StGB. Bribability and bribery within the meaning of Sec. 332 and 334 StGB are always accompanied by a breach of duty, therefore an official act contrary to his or her duty. Pursuant to Sec. 299 StGB it is a criminal offence for an employee or representative of a business company to demand, promise or accept an (undue) advantage in business transactions, so that in return he or she will get an unfair advantage in the competition of purchasing goods or commercial services. A criminal responsibility in relation to the actions of third parties may arise due to the legal concepts of direct and indirect perpetrator (Täter / mittelbarer Täter) or co-perpetrator (Mittäter) (Sec. 25 StGB) as well as accessory (Teilnehmer) consisting of instigation (Anstiftung, Sec. 26 StGB) and assistance (Beihilfe, Sec. 27 StGB). According to and of the UK Bribery Act of 2010 (UKBA), a company may be responsible for offences of so called associated persons if they bribe with the intent to obtain or retain business or a business advantage. An associated person of a company is defined as someone who performs services for or on behalf of a company. For example, an agent of a company qualifies as an associated person. Whether a third party performs services for or on behalf of a company is determined by a review of all relevant circumstances, and not merely the nature of the relationship between the third party and the company. The official further explains (p. 16) that a person who performs services for or on behalf of a company includes anyone connected to the company who might be capable of committing bribery on its behalf. This broad scope means that contractors and resellers could be associated persons. It is also noteworthy that of the UKBA provides a defense for companies that have in place adequate procedures designed to prevent associated persons from undertaking illegal conduct. According to Sections 78dd-1, 78dd-2, 78dd-3, 78m, 78ff of the US (FCPA), a company is liable for its agents and stockholders acting on its behalf if they behave corruptly towards any foreign official or provide financial benefits to any person while knowing that all or a portion of such will be used to corruptly influence or induce a foreign official to obtain or retain business or secure an improper advantage for the company. According to the official , the FCPA expressly prohibits corrupt payments made through third parties or intermediaries. Specifically,", "metadata": "4. Cooperation with Business Partners-8"}
{"text": "this covers payments made to any person, while knowing that all or a portion of such money or thing of value will be offered, given, or promised, directly or indirectly to a foreign official. Because the US Congress anticipated the use of third-party agents in bribery schemes and to avoid the related head-in-the-sand problem, it defined the knowing element as being aware of a high probability of a bribery payment. In so doing, the FCPA holds companies liable for a con­scious disregard, willful blindness or deliberate ignorance of a bribery scheme committed by third-party agents (). The FCPA Guidance also specifically identifies the pool of third parties to include agents, consultants, and distributors. At the same time, the FCPA also makes clear that risk-based due diligence is particularly important for the use of third-parties and such due diligence will be considered by the DOJ and the SEC in assessing the effectiveness of a company's com­pliance program (). The 2008 Settlement Agreement with the Department of Justice (DoJ) requires that all Siemens subsidiaries and affiliates indefinitely maintain an anti-corruption internal control system and corporate compliance program with specifically defined elements. This includes e.g. due diligence requirements (e.g. for Business Partners), a corporate official with overall responsibility for the implementation and oversight of the Siemens Compliance System globally, an effective reporting system and disciplinary procedures. The DOJ requirements have since become the framework of the Siemens Compliance System. Today, Siemens AG must ensure that all independently operating entities fully implement the core elements of the Siemens Compliance System. Failure to do so by any independently operating Siemens-owned entity would constitute a breach of the Settlement Agreement by Siemens AG, potentially resulting in the rescission of the Settlement Agreement. Business Partner portfolio and strategy review is mandatory for Digital Industries (DI), Smart Infrastructure (SI) and Siemens Mobility (SMO) on an annual basis. For other units, it must be decided by the respective management and the Compliance Officer. Business and Compliance jointly identify and analyze the business strategies involving the cooperation with Business Partners to develop a strategic business statement of the responsible CEO. The key objectives of the Business Partner Portfolio and Strategy Review are to help ensure: - a strategic focus to Business Partner engagements - an alignment with general business strategy - improved management awareness. The review should challenge the use of Business Partners reflecting the current set-up and taking the business strategies (e.g. go-to-market approach, sales channels, partner management, etc.) into consideration. The individual strategy is binding for the respective business. ! To facilitate the discussions, comprehensive information on all Business Partners should be obtained and include: - number of Business Partners, risk profile, type of services, service country, special risks e.g. cross border business, microenterprise, compensation type, adverse findings. - For specific high-risk partners: generated business versus commissions paid. The future business strategy must be obtained by the Compliance Officer from the responsible CEO / Strategy Team / Business Development and would typically include details on: - actual and potential new markets / portfolio - impact of changes in country specific political/economic outlook - particular customers, product line, geographical area, niche market, etc. - business areas most likely to require Business Partner support based on sales channel / go to market strategy. Example questions that Compliance may ask the Business: Does the current Sales Agent set-up reflect the sales channel strategy overall and/or in the respective countries?Does the Business Partner portfolio support the go to market approach related to Markets, Regions, Business Segments?Do you see future changes in the business model that might impact the Business Partner portfolio, for example: - new markets to be tapped using support from a Business Partner, - termination of non-performing businesses in certain countries, - decisions to change from an internal to an external sales force - MandA activities? The key deliverable of the Portfolio Review is the Strategic Business Partner statement of the CEO. The actual strategic statements of the Siemens entities can be found here: . The result of the respective workshop / statement is to be shared with the assigned countries and respective BUs. For certain Business Partners including their subsidiaries a centralized CDD is valid for all Siemens entities ( Global Business Partners ). For the work scope covered in a due diligence for a Global Business Partner and its subsidiaries, no local CDDs needs to be performed. Local contracts with the Global Business Partner and its listed subsidiaries will not require binding contract provisions if a central frame contract including binding contract provisions exists and reference to this frame contract is made.

It includes a face to face discussion with the Business Partner, ideally at their offices/premises. supporting an assessment and judgment of the appropriateness and suitability of the Business Partner to work with Siemens. There are two types of Compliance checks: - Initial check of a proposed Business Partner The initial compliance onsite check is a mandatory preventive measure in the Business Partner Due Diligence process. It must be performed prior to the approval of the CDD and formalization of the relationship with the Business Partner. Based on the following criteria the will after the risk assessment automatically determine, the requirement for a mandatory initial onsite check for Sales related Intermediaries () with a high risk CDD: - The Business Partner is located in a medium or high-risk country outside the country of the contracting Siemens entity and/or - The Business Partner country is not the country where the services are provided (but only if at least one of the countries is a high-risk country This onsite check is a onetime event (regardless of the number of active CDDs for the Business Partner). - Ad hoc check of an existing Business Partner The ad hoc compliance onsite check is a voluntary detective measure (e.g. as result of monitoring observations) on an existing Business Partner to identify and mitigate potential compliance risks arising from the existing relationship. The Compliance Officer of the Siemens entity who wants to engage the Business Partner is responsible that the check is undertaken. The compliance onsite check is performed by the Compliance organization that is responsible for the country where the Business Partner is located. For exceptional cases (e.g. the Business Partner is located in a country with no Siemens presence) the compliance check and/or due diligence can be outsourced to external service providers.

The Compliance Check Performer organizes an initial discussion for preparation of the Compliance Check with the Siemens Business representative. Important topics for discussion with the Business representative: - business rationale to hire the Business Partner - size of the Business Partner organization (including number of employees and other resources) - scope of service - contractual conditions (including remuneration) and performance - potential representatives from the Business Partner side who should attend the onsite visit  - Possible compliance risks (e.g. resulting from media information or connected to the future business). For checks on existing Business Partners, there might be several CDDs involving different Siemens AREs. An internal alignment with all relevant AREs (respective Business representatives) must be performed by the Compliance Check Performer to identify the most appropriate person from business that should coordinate the communication and potentially join the onsite review.

The report should not be shared with the Business Partner. The result of the Compliance Check can be: - Positive → No concerns identified. - Positive with Reservations → 'Reservations' are concerns that are not substantial to our decision to continue working with the Business Partner. Those reservations are not material or are easily remediated (i.e., potential shortcomings on their books and records or minor concerns about Business Partner internal processes). Such 'Reservations' do not affect the positive nature of our assessment and we consider the Business Partner suitable to continue working with Siemens. In case reservations are noted, required follow-up actions may be defined by the responsible Compliance Officer and documented in the Executive Summary and in Appendix 1 – Detailed report. - Negative → Material, compliance related concerns were detected that may require withdrawal from the proposed relationship or termination of contractual relationship.

If the Business Partner is an individual, select natural person In the extended key data section, register alias names of a Business Partner (step 1-step 4). An alias name can be a for example a pseudonym of the Business Partner but also the name in local characters. Alias names are also automatically checked against SETIS (Internet and World Compliance database and DAMEX-SPS, i.e. Sanctioned Party Screening) during the CDD. Example : If you have registered a company with the Business Partner name Lokotekh-Signal OOO in Russia, you should register the Alias LOKOTEKH-SIGNAL (without OOO) plus this name in local characters. This increases the accuracy of SETIS searches. Registration of legal representatives, shareholders, ultimate beneficial owners (UBO's) (only for high risk CDDs) For high risk CDDs, additional Business Partner key data related information to Legal Representatives, Shareholders and Ultimate Beneficial Owners (UBOs) is required. The risk level is determined by the CDD Risk Assessment at a later stage.

{"text": "information, please refer to chapter A.5. Business licenses / authorization Business licenses are permits issued by government agencies that allow individuals or companies to conduct business within the government's geographical jurisdiction. A single jurisdiction often requires multiple licenses that are issued by multiple government departments and agencies. Business licenses vary between countries, states, and local municipalities. There are often many licenses, registrations and certifications required to conduct a business in a single location. Typically, a company's business activity and physical location (address) determines which licenses are required to operate lawfully. Other determining factors may include the number of employees and the form of business ownership, such as sole proprietor or corporation. Also, in many jurisdictions a business must notify the responsible authority and register in official registers to perform business. If the business is entered in the trade or commercial registry, this entry also determines the correct and full company name. Often, also the address and legal representatives as well as additional date are shown in the commercial register. A list of company registers can also be found on Wikipedia. Independent background report (e.g. Dun & Bradstreet report, Creditreform, Sinotrust, Spark) An independent background report should contain information relevant to check the information provided by the Business Partner regarding: - Integrity of Business Partner - Business Partners ties (personal or business) to government or a government official - The names of all directors, officers, managing partners, owners, beneficial owners, majority shareholder, key employees - Civil or criminal judgements against the business partner. If there are any differences between the information in the report and the information provided by business partner, point this out to the Business Partner, obtain the business partners explanation and provide details. Credit Reports such as Dun & Bradstreet and Creditreform can be ordered via Siemens Global Information Sphere: https://sgi.siemens.com/home?f=credit&a=Resultlist!sm However, it is recommended that you contact your Compliance Officer to get information about local sources for such background report.

If key employees, shareholder and ultimate beneficial owner subcontractor exist, further checks need to be reviewed in these chapter. An approval decision for a CDD must be documented in the CDD-Tool. Contracts for high risk CDDs require an additional approval (outside of the CDD-Tool). Where integrity concerns exist, the Siemens unit must take appropriate steps – in cooperation with the relevant General Counsel and Compliance Officer – to mitigate the risk of corruption. Approval requirements depend on the CDD risk level. Approval steps are automatically set in the CDD-Tool. Low risk CDD - Management approval of CDD and contract: Management function of the respective Siemens unit according to the signature mandate of this unit. Medium risk CDD - Compliance review of CDD: Compliance Reviewer as defined in roles management tool (SCROM) - Management approval of CDD and contract: Management function of the respective Siemens unit according to the signature mandate of this unit or specific OpCo / Business Unit.

For the avoidance of doubt, further approvals for the contracts or alignment with dedicated departments within Siemens may be required to finalize a contract with the Business Partner. For example, Strategy ST TO is responsible for the preparation and conclusion of contracts between sales agents / distributors and Siemens AG allocating representation rights / sales rights to third parties to ensure that sales rights granted to the Business Partner do not overlap with those granted to other sales agents. Nevertheless, the Siemens unit concerned must make sure that the agency agreement contains the relevant compliance model clauses (see SC 140 Regional sales activities - Representation rights and sales rights for details).

Regular Updates: A Regular (mandatory) update of a CDD is due every three years from the last approval date. Only a limited number of questions must be re-answered. However, the CDD Responsible must check the CDD and must ensure that the content of the complete CDD is up to date and reflects the current relationship with the Business Partner. The following information must be newly answered: - Low risk: updated integrity search - Medium risk: as low risk plus a new version of the independent background report (Dun & Bradstreet) to be obtained and reviewed - High risk: as for low/medium plus update of organizational setup (Extended Key Data and group structure) and integrity checks (SETIS/internet and Involvement of Key Persons in litigations). The CDD Responsible gets an email notification to start an Update of a CDD and the approval process is streamlined depending on the significance of any changes as follows: - No", "metadata": "4. Cooperation with Business Partners-21"}
{"text": "significant changes: only sign-off by the CDD Responsible is required, with the Management Approver and CO Reviewer informed of the changes made via email. They may still raise questions and request further information if deemed necessary. - Significant changes: a re-approval by the Management and a repeat of the review by CO Reviewer responsible. An involvement of further stakeholders like CO Approver or CMC may be necessary. Only an increase of the risk level to high risk requires a documented Compliance approval. The CDD-Tool automatically determines the relevant approval process. Change of Regular Update Date: Compliance Officers can change the due date for a Regular Update. In order not to run the risk that the information in the CDD is not kept up to date, the date should be chosen sensibly. The new due date must not be in the past and max. 1 year later than the current due date. Ad hoc Updates: Between the three-year Regular Updates, the CDD Responsible is still obliged to keep the CDD up to date by starting an Ad Hoc Update. Any Update that constitutes a significant change will result in a reapproval as under the Regular Update. To further limit risk, every six months the Business Partner name and Aliases will be automatically screened via SETIS against our integrity database. In case of new hits Compliance Reviewers will be informed via email, asked to evaluate the hits and to initiate further actions if deemed necessary. The Regular and Ad hoc Update process is illustrated on the following picture: Regular Update and Ad Hoc Update The process of Regular and Ad hoc Updates is basically the same, but the Regular Update Process will reset answers to essential questions. These must be answered again by the CDD Responsible. Regular Update The request to update a CDD is made in 2 ways. One is by receiving an e-mail notification and the other is via My Dashboard in the CDD-Tool itself. Ad Hoc Update Hint Once the Update Process has started, it can no longer be stopped and must be run through to the end. If no changes are made, the Update Process is completed without a management approval. Before you start the update, please check in the Person Picker if the correct Management Approver has been selected. If the Approver needs to be changed, the new responsible persons can be added in the WCST (Who can see this?) section and then selected in the Person Picker.

If this CDD was performed by the same Siemens unit (ARE) and covers all aspects of the new engagement e.g. Business Partner type, scope of work, country, proposed remuneration and payment terms, this CDD can be used and no additional CDD is required. However, the new contract must be maintained in the contract section of this CDD. If the CDD was performed by a different ARE a new CDD must be performed even if all aspects of the business relationship are identical. Further, if the Business Partner is retained for a different scope of work, or if other circumstances of the CDD which may influence the approval decision are different from those which have already been approved in the existing CDD, a new CDD is necessary. The results of an existing CDD (parent) can be reused in certain cases to avoid double work using the Reference function for medium and high risk CDDs. For Global Business Partners refer to chapter A.4.3.. How to create a Reference - Step 1: Start new CDD and complete the Risk Assessment. - Step 2: If Reference is possible (Key Data and Risk Assessment of both CDDs are generally the same), select relevant CDD at the end of Risk Assessment and provide a comment. - Step 3 : Press Request Reference The request for Reference must be confirmed by Compliance and approved by Management How to confirm a Reference by Compliance - Step 1: Go to Review section - Step 2 : Press OK for Manager Approval Note: - DD Questionnaire is not applicable for References. - After confirmation by Compliance the Management Approver is informed via email to Approve the Reference CDD. (Ensure that Management Approver is maintained in Who can see this?) - Approval of a Reference does not mean that no separate contract is required to be signed / registered. Every Siemens unit must ensure that a valid contract with the Business Partner is existing and contract details are maintained in the CDDs Contracts section. - If the parent CDD becomes invalid, the existing Reference CDD must be changed to a standard CDD via the Update process. (Compliance Officers may use the Business Partner Dashboard to figure out References with invalid parent CDDs.) Note : CDD roles can be managed in the View mode of a CDD. There is no need to edit the CDD or to start an update of a CDD to change roles. In the Who can see this? section roles for CDD Responsible, Management Approver and CDD Viewer can be added or deleted. Management Approvers should be added manually in all cases. Compliance Officer roles (CO Reviewer, CO Approver) are maintained in the Compliance role Management system SCROM and cannot be manually added in this section.

If the contract status of a CDD is not concluded or terminated for one year, the CDD will be automatically closed (in accordance with the data deletion concept). Closing and cancellation are done with the same process steps. How to cancel a CDD Step 1: In the view mode of a CDD (not in the edit mode) press the three dots to open the menu bar. Press Close / Cancel CDD Step 2: In the pop-up window, enter a comprehensive comment why the CDD should be cancelled. Step 3 : Press OK Note: A cancelled CDD gets a cancellation flag and the status cancelled but is not immediately physically deleted (according to data deletion concept). How to reactivate a CDD A cancelled or closed CDD can be reactivated by a Compliance Officer Step 1: In the view mode of a CDD (not in the edit mode) press the three dots to open the menu bar. Press Reactivate CDD. Step 2: In the pop-up window, enter a comprehensive comment why the CDD should be reactivated. Step 3 : Press OK. Compliance Officer can flag a Business Partner as under observation or as centrally disapproved In the Alerts & Audits Result section. A Centrally Disapproval should be performed e.g. in case of a negative result of a CF A audit or an internal investigation (if it is aligned with the investigation team). If a Business Partner is centrally disapproved no further CDD can be performed. A Business Partner should be flagged as under observation e.g. in case of negative information that requires further monitoring. If a Business Partner is flagged as under observation or as centrally disapproved, all persons involved in CDDs for the Business Partner get an e-mail notification. To flag a Business Partner as centrally disapproved or as under observation, please refer toC.2.2.6. The documents can be sent to the Business Partner for the collection of Information needed for the DD questionnaire: Medium risk due diligence High risk due diligence Information about Siemens Audit and Books & Records requirements must be sent to medium and high-risk Business Partners. The Business Partner must understand the scope of such audits and the expectations of transparent Books & Records. Based on the binding contract provisions for medium and high risk due diligences (A.6.), Siemens has the right to perform audits in the event that - there is a reason to believe that there is a breach of Compliance provisions by the Business Partner or - internal assessments indicate a potential corruption risk for Siemens.

{"text": "z Compliance Handbook Part 1 B. Antitrust Compliance with Antitrust law is of highest importance for Siemens. Infringements of Antitrust law result in very significant risks: they range from very large fines and Siemens' exclusion from public tenders to prison sentences for Siemens employees. In addition, the risks of private damages actions being pursued on the basis of Antitrust law infringements continue to increase. The internationalization of Antitrust enforcement has multiplied these risks – significantly more than 100 countries have now introduced Antitrust laws. For an internationally active company such as Siemens, it is therefore all the more important to conduct its worldwide business operation in compliance with Antitrust law. Antitrust principles - Employees must comply with all applicable Antitrust laws in accordance with their obligations under such laws and with their obligations under Circular 226 and Chapter G2 of the Business Conduct Guidelines (Fair competition and anti-trust laws) and this chapter. - The basic principles of Antitrust law are clear and simple: competitors must not enter into anti-competitive agreements with each other, in particular if they concern hard core conduct such as price fixing or market sharing. - All (possible) breaches of Antitrust law must be reported without delay. Employees can use any of the following reporting options: Line managers, Legal and Compliance, Tell us or the Siemens-Ombudsman. Senior management and line managers must ensure that, in accordance with their statutory organizational and supervisory obligations, no infringements of Antitrust law are committed and that the company and its employees are protected. Siemens management does not tolerate any violations of Antitrust law and will take rigorous action against persons guilty of intentional infringement. All employees must be aware of Antitrust-related risks, comply with applicable Antitrust rules and consult the experts in Legal and Compliance if in any doubt in any particular case. The Siemens Antitrust Compliance Program is based on the following principles: - clear communication from management regarding the necessity of Antitrust Compliance - targeted identification of Antitrust-related risks by way of a regular Antitrust Risk Exposure Assessment (AREA) and monitoring of new developments and lessons learned - professional and comprehensive Antitrust advice and Antitrust training programs - rigorous investigation of, and the imposition of disciplinary sanctions for, infringements of Antitrust law and - regular review and further development of the Antitrust Program. Basic information and supporting material on Antitrust and Trade Secrets law and the relevant Compliance requirements are available on the Homepage of LC M&A CMP. There, employees may find general guidance documents as well as papers and presentations dedicated to specific topics like trade association meetings or competitive intelligence. In case of questions, direct contact to the legal experts of LC M&A CMP should be sought. - Compliance Officer The Compliance Officer responsible for your unit can be found through the following link. - Corporate Governance Owner The contact person for Antitrust is: Georg Boettcher (Chief Counsel Competition) The contact persons for the Compliance Handbook content Antitrust are: Annette Kraus (LC CO IR) Georg Boettcher (LC M&A CMP)", "metadata": "B.

{"text": "This chapter describes the Case-based Remediation Process, i.e. basically the roles, process steps and activities put in place for compliance remediation when compliance violations have been established during compliance investigations or forensic audits. The main objective is to share among the stakeholders involved in a remediation case a common understanding of the different roles involved, their rights and duties and the activities necessary to remediate the compliance violation. Please note: This document only covers remediation activities resulting from central investigations, i.e. investigations mandated by the CCO and conducted either by the central investigation team (LC CO IR), or an external law firm. Remediation measures resulting from local investigations or regular CF A audit mandates, for example, do not fall within the scope of this document. Structure of this chapter The document first describes the case-based remediation project organization and the roles involved in the remediation process. This includes the roles at corporate level, in the OPCOs or the entity where the remediation measures have to be implemented (chapter 2). The document then goes on to describe the overall process steps to be conducted during a compliance remediation (chapter 3). If you would just like to obtain a general overview of the process, you may only read this chapter. Standard activities or sub-activities are then explained in more detail (chapter 4). A table which rephrases or amends the textual process description has been added for each sub-activity. It details the activity and lists the standard inputs and outputs. Comments have been provided which can help the reader to better understand and implement the activity. The table shall be used when the detailed information contained is required, for example to clarify which steps should typically be taken or which output is expected. Finally, an annex is provided which contains, among other things, a glossary defining names, concepts and abbreviations used in the document and templates and guidelines supporting the process implementation and performance (chapter 5). How to use The document is intended for persons involved during the case-based remediation process. This includes members of the Compliance Organization as well as other functions involved in the process (e.g. legal, tax, human resources, finance & accounting, audit, etc.). Depending on the individual's familiarity with the remediation process, the document can be: - either read through from beginning to end in order to understand, for example, the roles, tasks, outcomes, and interfaces in the remediation process, - or used occasionally as the specification and reference of the standard remediation process, e.g., in order to solve any differences in understanding between: - the remediation process between different stakeholders - or the responsibilities, rights and duties of these stakeholders. As the document has been approved and released, it is both a reference and a binding document for any case-based remediation. Nevertheless, the process must be tailored to each remediation case as appropriate. The specific case-based remediation process must be shared, documented and agreed upon among those involved in the remediation case ultimately, the objective is to share a common understanding on how to remediate a specific compliance violation effectively and efficiently. Case-based remediation is commonly carried out in the form of a project, meaning project management methods and techniques are used in the project as appropriate. This section describes the major roles involved in the remediation process, i.e. the functions that individuals, groups or parts of the Siemens organization have to perform in order to participate in remediation of a compliance violation. The description of the roles has been structured in accordance with their involvement in the remediation project: - Regular project team members - Additional team members involved in the project as required - Interface functions, who are for the most part only kept informed of project progress or which are required to escalate issues which cannot be solved within the respective remediation project. The Remediation Team consists of both regular project team members and additional team members. Some role assignments are implicit within the Siemens or compliance organization (e.g., OPCO Management, OPCO Compliance Officer). Others have to be determined with regard to the specific remediation case, i.e. individuals have to be assigned to the role explicitly. In general, one dedicated person is assigned to a role. If required, several persons may be assigned to a role. On the other hand, one person can own one or more roles at the same time. Some roles may be mutually exclusive (e.g., Remediation Manager and Case Lawyer). Criteria for the role assignment shall be the competence required to fulfill the task but also, for example, availability, commitment of the role owner and empowerment through the organization. Role assignment fit is one of the keys for a successful compliance remediation.

The Remediation Team Lead analyzes the investigation report in order to understand the findings related to the case and to identify the activities required to remediate the compliance violation. He determines the remediation case class (major, medium, low, as defined in Section 5.3.3.) and he assigns the Remediation Manager (RM) to the case. Step 2: Plan. The Remediation Manager analyzes the investigation report in more detail to establish the remediation plan. Besides doing this, he identifies and sets up the team which will be in charge of the remediation case. Step 3: Execute. The Remediation Manager organizes and kicks off the Remediation Team. The remediation measures are planned in detail. Responsibilities and deadlines are agreed upon. The measures are implemented by the stakeholders involved as planned. The Remediation Manager monitors and controls the progress of the implementation and intermediate results. He identifies and initiates corrective actions as appropriate. Step 4: Document. The Remediation Manager gathers and analyzes the evidence relating to the remediation. When all material is available and complete, he writes up the remediation report.

The Remediation Manager distributes the remediation report to a standard distribution list as defined in section 5.3.5. and archives the relevant documents (remediation reports, evidence) as appropriate. He also updates the respective tracking tools (e.g. TRACI). When completed, the remediation case can be closed. Report & Analyze Risks. The section describes case-independent activities. Reporting for OPCO, Corporate or Lead Country and Corporate CRB is done periodically for all projects within the Compliance and Risk Organization. Data for further risk analysis is prepared. Lessons Learned are performed. The degree of implementation (DI) is monitored and updated individually for each remediation measure through each of the process steps in order to reflect their level of completion. As remediation measures have been identified in the investigation report, the remediation process usually starts with DI2 (See annex, Table 2 Degree of Implementation). Chart 2: Remediation Process Overview Basically, this section describes the activities within the five process steps and the step-independent activities. Inputs and preconditions for the activities, and the work and outputs of the activities are specified. The goal of a process is to establish the collaboration between the stakeholders and to generate outcomes as efficiently as possible and at low risk to the project objectives. Therefore, it may be necessary to adapt the process and procedures to the project objectives in order to generate the outcomes appropriately.

{"text": "Siemens Integrity Initiative The Legal and Compliance Collective Action & External Affairs Team (LC CO RFC CA, Collective Action Team) coordinates the Collective Action activities at Siemens. Collective Action was started in 2008 and is an activity field of the Siemens Compliance System and described in the Siemens Circular 226, Chapter 3 Prevent, Article 12 Collective Action as well as in the Compliance Operating Model Chapter 2.2 Prevent and its Appendix Summary of mandatory items. Collective Action, which involves building alliances against corruption in order to level the playing field, is an integral part of the Siemens Compliance System and one of the priority focus topics. All Siemens units planning Collective Action activities: - should involve their respective Compliance Officer and the Compliance Collective Action team. - must follow theAntitrust Guidance forCollective Action (Compliance Handbook, G.3.). Siemens actively drives the implementation of Collective Action and aims to set up projects with partners in industry, the public sector, non-governmental organizations, international organizations and civil society. In addition, Siemens has started the Siemens Integrity Initiative with a budget of more than US$ 100m as part of the settlement agreed with the World Bank in July 2009 and the European Investment Bank (EIB) in March 2013. The initiative funds organizations, projects and training activities worldwide in the fight against corruption. More information can be found at: www.siemens.com/collective-action and www.siemens.com/integrity-initiative. Over recent years, Siemens has successfully introduced and implemented a comprehensive global Collective Action program and the Siemens Integrity Initiative to jointly fight corruption and promote integrity in business transactions. The ultimate goal is to establish fair and sustainable market conditions in collaboration with other companies, governments and non-governmental organizations for the benefit of all market participants. - Corruption is theft from a country and its citizens. It cripples democratic and economic development and distorts fair competition. - Money flowing into dark channels is absorbed and is therefore unavailable for investments in infrastructure. This limits the prosperity of an economy. - Experience has shown that, without an adequate anticorruption culture based on Long-Term Initiatives, Integrity Pacts and Compliance Pacts are difficult to implement or do not result in sustainable change. - We have therefore concentrated our focus on further expanding Long-Term Initiatives, which are also supported by the Siemens Integrity Initiative. - We are continuously driving our strategy: from fighting corruption to market development through business-minded Collective Action activities The benefits: Lower levels of corruption help to develop markets and reduce risks. More public spending will be available financial and socio-economic stability is fostered investors are attracted civil society is encouraged peace and security dialog is supported. The result: Increased market volumes with higher addressable market shares for suppliers based on fair competition, which ultimately drives innovation and prosperity for all stakeholders. Collective Action enables corruption to be fought collectively, with various interest groups working together and building an alliance against corruption so that the problem can be approached and resolved from multiple angles. It calls for cooperation on the part of participants from the worlds of politics, business and society at large. The ultimate goal of Collective Action is to create fair and equitable market conditions and thus establish a level playing field for all marketplace participants, eliminating the temptation of corruption for all those concerned. Collective Action is therefore part of the Siemens Compliance Priority Foster Integrity. All in all, Collective Action and the Siemens Integrity Initiative are a key element to ensure clean business and to mitigate risk. In the face of the widespread and deep-rooted corruption problem that affects society in general, governments and their procuring entities and the private sector in equal measure, it seems highly unlikely that individual activities alone will be sufficient to bring about significant ethical changes and improve the transparency of business processes. This is precisely where Collective Action methods come into their own. Collective Action methods make it possible for us to fight corruption collectively, working together with the various interest groups to build an alliance against corruption and to approach and resolve the problem from multiple angles. The ultimate aim of these joint efforts is to create fair and equal market conditions – a level playing field – for all market players and eliminate the temptations of corruption for all. Collective Action promotes a fair competitive situation in which a transparent process based exclusively on market economic criteria (such as quality, price, innovation and service) ensures that the contract is awarded to the best bidder. It prevents competition from being distorted and destroyed by corruption and ensures that companies acting honestly and morally are not disadvantaged. The success of the initiative hinges to a great extent on the trust and commitment of the parties at the highest management level, as well as a general consensus regarding the consequences and sanctions to be applied", "metadata": "G. Collective Action and Siemens Integrity Initiative-1"}
{"text": "if the agreed processes and rules are breached. It is important for each participant to demonstrate the credibility of its intentions by implementing its own compliance program to a recognized standard. The available methods range from Integrity Pacts for individual procurement transactions right through to industry-specific Codes of Conduct and Compliance Pacts, as well as joint measures implemented as part of a long-term initiative to raise a country's public awareness and tighten up its regulatory system and procurement guidelines. Ideally, such action should involve competitors, authorities, non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and other interest groups working jointly for the common good. It is also crucial to examine the antitrust aspects in each individual case. Siemens is engaged in a variety of cooperative projects with NGOs (non-governmental organizations) and IOs (international organizations) committed to fighting corruption and establishing and maintaining freedom of competition. We have, for example, been very actively involved in the Collective Action working group of the World Bank Institute. We are also a permanent member of the working group for the tenth principle (anti-corruption) of the UN Global Compact and of the Commission on Anti-Corruption of the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC), as well as a long-standing Sherpa in the G20/20 process since 2011. Through our cooperation with NGOs and IOs such as the World Bank, we are continuously working to improve our established Compliance Program in dialogue with our partners and assume a leading role in the field of compliance and transparency. With the clear objective of becoming a respected international partner in the fight against corruption, we are striving to extend this commitment even further in the future. As described in the previous chapter , Collective Action enables corruption to be fought collectively, with various interest groups working together and building an alliance against corruption so that the problem can be approached and resolved from multiple angles. The advantages of Collective Action: - Collective Action combines various methods of combating corruption. It involves acting collectively and forming alliances against corruption. - Collective Action calls for cooperation on the part of participants from the worlds of politics, business and society at large. - Its ultimate goal is to create fair and equitable market conditions and thus establish a level playing field for all marketplace participants, eliminating the temptation of corruption for all those concerned. - Collective Action helps to set up the conditions for fair competition within a corrupt environment. - Collective Action promotes innovation, as bidders are selected solely on the basis of their price, quality and capacity to innovate. - Observance of antitrust law when collaborating with other companies must be ensured by a neutral monitor (for example in the form of a non-governmental organization). - Collective Action can, if necessary, cover gaps in legislation or replace or augment inadequate local law. At Siemens, the Collective Action methods encompass project-specific, sector-wide and long-term initiatives. All activities, global and local, are driven through complementary channels. This is partly illustrated in the House of Collective Action and its individual parts are described below: Integrity Pacts help to ensure that the procedure for awarding orders in public-sector contracts is free from corruption. These methods were developed by the non-governmental organization Transparency International. They are intended to guarantee transparency in the order-awarding process and to rule out bribery in the awarding of public-sector contracts. Following an invitation to tender from a public-sector customer, the bidding companies sign legally binding contracts, and commit themselves to behaving with integrity from the start of the tender process until the end of the project. If the contract is breached, sanctions are imposed, which can be as severe as the exclusion of the company from further invitations to tender. An independent monitor supervises the contract-awarding process and observance of the Integrity Pact. Integrity Pacts help to ensure that bidders are selected on the basis of fair criteria and serve all the stakeholders as a means of protecting the integrity of the project. Please refer to Integrity Pact Templates at the Collective Action Download Center. (Under category Collective Action Legal Center of Competence) For support with the templates, please contact Christina Wolfgramm or Ulrike Desimoni (LC CO RFC LF). Companies from the same sector get together and draw up a code of ethics or code of conduct. These can take various forms, ranging from principles-based provisions to legally binding agreements. In the latter case, companies that violate the anticorruption code are penalized with sanctions. However the principles-based codes also have a high degree of effectiveness, as especially the public commitment to anticorruption and transparency exerts increased pressure on the participating companies not to breach the agreement. This type of Collective Action is particularly suitable in oligopolistic markets. The uncompromising support of senior management within the companies concerned is critical to the success of the initiative. In order", "metadata": "G.

Long-Term Initiatives are particularly effective in states rated as being prone to corruption, as they are essential to pave the way to the establishment of a true anti-corruption culture. Collaboration between government, commercial companies and society in the fight against corruption helps to raise awareness among politicians and the general public. The acknowledgment that bribery and corrupt behavior damage the entire economy of a state brings long-term benefits for all stakeholders. Long-Term Initiatives set out the fundamental conditions that will enable project-specific Integrity Pacts and industry-specific Compliance Pacts to come to fruition and achieve general acceptance. Their success contributes to a world free from corruption and helps to direct the investment of many millions of euros and other resources toward their intended destination. In addition, and as an important element of our Long Term Initiatives, Siemens is deeply engaged in the B20 Task Forces on Improving Transparency and Anti-Corruption. Since 2011 we have been able to present our positions in the global consultation process at the G20/B20 summits in France, Mexico, Russia, Australia, Turkey, China, Germany, Argentina, Japan, and currently in Saudi Arabia. As described in the background, our many engagements in e.g. the New York-based United Nations Global Compact (10th Principle), our work with the Commission on Corporate Responsibility and Anti-corruption of the International Chamber of Commerce in Paris, our representation of Siemens in the World Economic Forum's Pact Against Corruption Initiative (PACI) in Switzerland, and other C-Level support contribute to our Long-Term Initiatives. In April 2011, we started Phase II of the Collective Action Country Strategy & Stakeholder Mapping Process and have implemented an ongoing process since then. Please find our latest Stakeholder Mapping Analysis, dated April 2018 here. Collective Action Stakeholder Mapping - ensures a thorough analysis of the specific country situation and permits a structured approach to potential anticorruption stakeholders in the individual country - helps the responsible Compliance Officer to identify suitable Collective Action partners in the Siemens countries - supports the establishment of strong relations with our Collective Action stakeholders - fosters a climate of confidence, which in turn facilitates dialog - enables stakeholders to share their expertise and engage collectively in anticorruption - will help to enable a better understanding of specific stakeholder expectations and the concerns of various players and helps to develop a strong anticorruption community and network in all Siemens countries. Knowing your stakeholders is: - the prerequisite for selecting partners for Collective Action against corruption - the successful implementation of Long-Term Initiatives and partnerships, the latter of which provide the basis for facilitating Integrity Pacts and Compliance Pacts in your country by strengthening the anti-corruption mindset - active stakeholder engagement in the longer term (even if you do not engage in successful cooperation with a certain stakeholder now, it is worthwhile to stay in contact and to look for opportunities for Collective Action in the future) - the development of future Collective Action opportunities and the positioning of Siemens as an anticorruption leader Over recent years, Siemens has successfully introduced and implemented a comprehensive global Collective Action Program to jointly fight corruption and promote integrity in business transactions. The ultimate goal is to establish fair and sustainable market conditions in collaboration with other companies, governments and non-governmental organizations for the benefit of all market participants. Therefore, Collective Action promotes a level playing field in which a transparent process based exclusively on the attractiveness of companies' product or service offerings (such as quality, price, innovation and customer service) ensures that the contract is awarded to the best bidder. Collective Action prevents competition from being distorted and destroyed by corruption and ensures that companies acting honestly and morally are not disadvantaged. As Siemens' Collective Action activities include collaboration with other (possibly competing) companies, care must be taken to avoid any conflict of such contacts or discussions with antitrust rules. Within the framework of the Collective Action Program, discussions with other companies on the coordination of anti-corruption initiatives in compliance with the limits set by LC M&A CMP below are entirely legitimate. Accordingly, care must be taken to ensure that when discussing such issues, competitors do not use the opportunity to enter into anticompetitive agreements or give each other insight into confidential information that ought not to be shared. The key principle is that all Siemens employees who have contact with other (possibly competing) companies in the", "metadata": "G. Collective Action and Siemens Integrity Initiative-3"}
{"text": "context of Collective Action activities must bear in mind that antitrust law requires every company to compete autonomously, on its own merits. This is the case regardless of how laudable the purpose of the cooperation is. In other words, the fact that companies work together to root out corruption and other illicit business practices does not mean that antitrust law is applied any less strictly to such cooperation. Contacts or discussions between companies in the context of Collective Action activities must not be used to agree, implement or enforce any kind of anti-competitive agreement, e.g. related to price fixing, market sharing, bid rigging or collusive tendering, agreements on production / capacities / investments, supplier / customer boycotts. In addition, Collective Action activities must not be used by competitors to jointly agree on terms of trade to be used with customers. For example, it would not be permissible for competitors to agree that they will no longer agree to unlimited liability clauses in their contracts with customers. Similarly, it may raise antitrust issues to agree not to purchase products or services in specified countries (e.g. due to high corruption risks or low human rights standards) or to agree on certain payment terms with the aim of avoiding terms that would enable the concealment of kickback payments (e.g. cash payments, payment by cheque). Care must also be taken not to agree on minimum standards in relation to certain areas where, in the absence of mandatory regulation, companies would be competing against each other. For example, it is legitimate for companies to agree to all comply with a particular country's minimum wage legislation. However, it may be problematic to agree on minimum wage standards that exceed mandatory standards. In addition, competitively relevant information that can enable competitors to coordinate their conduct on the market must not be exchanged, e.g.: - prices, price components, rebates and other factors influencing price, production, marketing and other costs - supply/customer relationships (names of suppliers/customers) - market strategy, product launches, R&D projects - investments, withdrawal from business areas or - ther competitively relevant business and trade secrets. When organizing Collective Action activities and meeting representatives of other (possibly competing) companies at Collective Action gatherings, please bear in mind the following key points: - It is preferable that Collective Action meetings in which competitors are involved are organized by, and carried out under the auspices of, neutral facilitators such as NGOs or international organizations - All interested parties should be able to participate freely in the Collective Action activities, both in the deliberations about new Collective Action measures, as well as in the measures finally agreed - Any decision to implement a particular measure should be made in an open and transparent process - There should be an agenda for any Collective Action meeting, and the discussions should not stray from the agenda without good reason - No competitively relevant information should be discussed - If problematic issues are discussed, leave the meeting immediately and contact Legal and Compliance - You should be particularly careful during the social side of such meetings (meals, hotel bar, etc.). In the context of Collective Action, there may be occasions when Siemens employees contact employees working for competitors or vice-versa. For example, there may be occasions when employees of competing companies discuss whether a particular tender should be supported by an integrity pact. Alternatively, a company may initiate discussions about entering into a compliance pact for a particular business area or transaction. In the context of Collective Action, direct contact with competitors is generally acceptable as long as the discussions relate purely to the putting in place of appropriate Collective Action arrangements, and do not lead to either anticompetitive agreements or illegal information exchange. However, the basic rule remains that Siemens employees must not speak to competitors unless they have a compelling business reason to do so and that they can be sure that no antitrust issues arise. As the dividing line between appropriate and inappropriate actions is particularly fine when direct contacts between Siemens and its competitors occur, Siemens employees are encouraged to contact the experts at LC M&A CMP if they have any questions about antitrust rules as they relate to Collective Action.

With total funding of more than US$ 100 million, the initiative supports organizations and projects that fight corruption and fraud through Collective Action, education and training.

{"text": "2009, with projects being announced beginning in December 2010. Under the Second Funding Round, which started in 2013, selected projects are to receive approximately US$ 35,554 million of funding over a period of three to five years. The Third Funding Round was launched on March 13, 2018 (see Press Release) and offered a funding volume of up to US$ 30 million for up to 25 projects. In order to achieve an overall geographically balanced portfolio of projects in the Third Funding Round, preference was given to projects with activities in the following countries: Adriatic Region, Angola, Argentina, Brazil, China, Colombia, Egypt, India, Indonesia, Iran, Iraq, Ivory Coast, Kenya, Korea, Libya, Morocco, Mozambique, Myanmar, Nigeria, Pakistan, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Spain, South Africa, Syria, Tunisia, Turkey, United Arab Emirates, Ukraine. Following the announcement of the application modalities, we received applications for the Third Funding Round from some 140 organizations from more than 50 countries with a requested funding volume of more than USD 280 million. From this large number, we have committed funding to 22 projects for a total of USD 25.2 million for the most innovative and promising project proposals. The projects meet our eligibility and selection criteria as described in our Green Booklet. Under the leadership of LC CO RFC CA, a global interdisciplinary team (Compliance, Legal, Tax, Finance, Regional Compliance Officers) has conducted a thorough due diligence of the applications before the final selection. The selection of projects takes into account both the range of topics and the regional distribution of funding. As part of the Siemens-World Bank settlement agreement, the World Bank has audit rights over the use of funds (US$ 100 million over a period of 15 years beginning in 2009) and veto rights over the selection of projects by Siemens. The agreement between Siemens and the European Investment Bank (€ 13.64 million over five years) gives the EIB the right to reject the projects proposed. As of March 2020, we have supported 77 projects with a committed funding of USD 98.5 million. Overall, our projects are making good progress, and we report on them publicly every year (see, for example, the Siemens Integrity Initiative Annual Report 2019). The projects backed in the first rounds of funding have made a tangible difference locally, in regions and sectors, and we are particularly pleased to see more and more committed and well-connected supporters rallying to the Collective Action banner and joining our common effort to fight corruption. At the request of the World Bank, all 55 projects of the first two funding rounds have in 2017 undergone an external evaluation by the Universalia Management Group, who conclude that the overall findings of the Mid-term Review are positive. Please refer to our Siemens Integrity Initiative Annual Report 2017, which includes the summary of the Mid-term Review. Main observations of the Mid-term Review are: - The Siemens Integrity Initiative has positively pushed ahead the agendas on Collective Action - Since its establishment in 2009, the Integrity Initiative has gained the respect of many anti-corruption actors around the world. - It has highlighted the role of the private sector in fighting corruption and fraud and demonstrates the business case for investing in Collective Action. - It has contributed to strengthening the organizational capacities of several Integrity Partners. - It has made some contributions to fostering the generation and exchange of knowledge among anti-corruption actors. - Siemens' management approach made effective use of the company's global presence and ensured high levels of accountability , which allowed the Integrity Initiative to trace every dollar spent.

{"text": "Prior to the acquisition or divestment of a company, a part of a company or an interest in a company, it is necessary to evaluate the potential compliance risks for Siemens and mitigate them by taking appropriate action. This applies also to measures taken in preparation – for example, in the case of carve-outs. M&A principles - Regardless of the type of transaction involved – for example, a share deal, an asset deal or a merger – a Compliance Due Diligence must be conducted prior to the I-Application. - MAP DF&CLM in alignment with LC CO RFC LF M&A provides comments on the proposed transaction usually prior to the I-Application. - For (1) projects of EUR 100 million or more or (2) in embargoed countries or (3) if specific compliance issues might be indicated, MAP DF&CLM and LC CO RFC LF M&A have to be involved already in preparation of the P-Proposal and have to provide comments to the P-Proposal of a proposed transaction respectively. Prior to every investment and divestment decision, an assessment of compliance-related risks - referred to as a Compliance Due Diligence - must be conducted. In particular, the following applies: Regardless of the type of transaction involved – for example, a share deal, an asset deal or a merger – a Compliance Due Diligence must be conducted prior to the I-Application at the latest, in any case - before the acquisition or divestment of a company or a part of a company - before the acquisition or divestment of an interest in a company. MAP DF&CLM in alignment with LC CO RFC LF M&A provides comments on the proposed transaction usually prior to the I-Application. However, in case 1. the materiality threshold of a proposed transaction of EUR 100 million is exceeded, 2. the proposed transaction takes place in a so-called embargo country or 3. ther indications for potentially compliance critical topics exist, MAP DF&CLM and LC CO RFC LF M&A have to be involved already in preparation of the P-Proposal and have to provide comments to the P-Proposal of a proposed transaction respectively. The execution of a Compliance Due Diligence constitutes a work stream within the M&A due diligence process. Further information and tools relating to this process are available on the MAP DF&CLM intranet site. The M&A negotiator must involve MAP DF&CLM as early as possible in the course of the project (for example, in the case of divestments, already at the carve-out stage). MAP DF&CLM is responsible for conducting the Compliance Due Diligence in alignment with LC CO RFC LF M&A and, if necessary, with the involvement of the compliance organization of the unit responsible for the transaction and of the compliance organization in the regions. LC CO RFC LF M&A has the governance for the contents of the Compliance Due Diligence. In addition, LC CO RFC LF M&A has the governance for mandating and supervising of external compliance consultants which is determined together with MAP DF&CLM on a project-specific basis. LC CO RFC LF M&A provides MAP and the unit responsible for the transaction with legal advice in compliance-related matters in connection with M&A transactions, majority investments, joint ventures and minority investments. This regulation does not affect LC M&A's responsibility for providing advice in respect of contracts for mergers and acquisitions, majority investments, joint ventures and minority investments. For investments by N47 a specific process without involvement of MAP applies. Subject of a Compliance Due Diligence is, in particular, the contracting party and the company or part of a company that is to be (partially) acquired or sold. The Compliance Due Diligence should in particular focus on risks in the areas of corruption, antitrust law, money laundering, data privacy, export control, human rights and indications of criminal or administrative offences or criminal investigations or monetary fine proceedings against the contracting party, its shareholders, the company, its management, or against any employees with a key role in the transaction, all of the foregoing in respect of the company´s business activities, as well as on breaches of recordkeeping obligations. MAP DF&CLM and LC CO RFC LF M&A have to document the results of a Compliance Due Diligence and report the results to the M&A negotiator. The results have to be adequately taken into consideration in the course of the negotiations, in particular, when drafting the contract. If risks identified in the Compliance Due Diligence cannot be adequately taken into account, MAP DF&CLM and LC CO RFC LF M&A, have to document this fact and provide an assessment of the resulting compliance-related risks in the respective decision proposal. In addition, mitigation proposals with regard to the remaining compliance-related risks have to be provided. The compliance organization of the unit responsible for the transaction must ensure the implementation of the proposed mitigation measures to reduce the", "metadata": "I.

{"text": "remaining compliance-related risks. In this connection, the compliance organization will be supported by LC CO RFC LF M&A and, if necessary, by MAP DF&CLM. When a company or a majority interest in a company is acquired through a M&A transaction, the Siemens unit taking over the business is obliged to set up – within 12 months from closing and in accordance with the Mandatory Items set out in the Integration Master Planner (IMP) – a compliance system that meets Siemens' standards. When a minority interest is acquired, the M&A negotiator must undertake every effort to contractually agree with the relevant other parties in the transaction the implementation of an adequate Compliance System in the acquired business considering the specifics of the business and the transaction. Depending on these specifics, an adequate compliance system for minority investments should usually comprise at least the following components: - tone from the top (a clear commitment by top management to combat compliance violations) - execution of business-related risk assessments in respect of compliance – focusing, in particular on topics relating to anti-corruption, antitrust laws and anti-money laundering - nomination of compliance officers - drafting and implementing of a set of compliance regulations (covering, for example, the treatment of gifts and invitations as well as dealings with business partners) - the implementation of communication and training measures - a system for taking receipt of reports of suspected misconduct, investigating the compliance allegations and, where applicable, sanctioning such violations - regular reviews of implemented compliance measures – focusing, in particular, on anti-corruption, antitrust and anti-money laundering measures - establishment of a corporate culture that is committed to compliance. Regarding the monitoring of Compliance in minority shareholdings after closing, see Chapter H.6. During the formation of a joint venture, the M&A negotiator must ensure – even in case of a minority interest – that the contractual partner cannot unilaterally change the compliance standards in place at the joint venture. If this is not negotiable and cannot be agreed in the contract, this fact must be documented by LC M&A and communicated to MAP DF&CLM and LC CO RFC LF M&A so that it can be taken into account in the decision proposal and in the decision to invest / divest in an appropriate way. In case of a divestiture of a company, a part of a company or an interest in a company, the M&A negotiator and LC M&A must ensure that Siemens' obligations vis-à-vis government authorities (for example, the SEC, the U.S. Department of Justice) and other organizations relating to the agreement of specific compliance-related regulations are fulfilled. Such requirements must be reflected in the contract with the purchaser in an appropriate way. LC CO RFC LF M&A has to inform the MAP organization and LC M&A regarding the respective compliance-related obligations. LC CO RFC LC M&A manages the carve-out and stand-alone process for all Compliance related topics in divestment projects. The tasks include the management of the Workstream Compliance (blue team) in carve-out / stand-alone projects, as well as the management of the baselining and TSA (transitional service agreement) processes, the implementation of the Siemens Compliance system in the newly founded entities and the development of concepts for an independent stand-alone compliance system together with the target business and ensuring the implementation of this system. - Circular No. 222 Application for and approval of capital investments and divestments - Code of practice for compliance due diligences in M&A transactions - Circular No. 206 Corporate Governance Rules for Siemens' Equity Investments - Integration Master Planner (IMP) - ARE Masterlist Date Author Major changes of binding content January 1, 2019 Karin Bliemel LC CO RFC LF M&A) First Release through the Compliance Handbook based on Siemens Circular SC No. 226 Global Compliance.

Any response to such a request must be coordinated in advance with LC CO IR CF (This chapter about dawn raids can be printed out or separately filed as Pdf here in order to have the content close to hand 1) In the event of an unannounced entry request by public authorities (dawn raid), the principles set out below must be observed to the extent permitted by local law . The principles must be adjusted in accordance with local law requirements and may be amended appropriately to provide local dawn raid guidance. Supporting documents (such as a standard notification form for security and reception staff or information on the local intranet) may be added if appropriate and in consultation with Siemens AG Legal and Compliance (Compliance Investigation and Regulatory and Legal Competition). Security and reception staff especially must be made aware of these principles and of the difference between an announced visit by the authorities and a dawn raid. The following public authorities in particular might conduct a dawn raid: - Public prosecutor's office - Investigative judge's office and Antitrust agencies - Police/federal/state investigative bureaus - Tax fraud investigators - Customs inspectors - Secret service units - Other public investigating agencies In case of a dawn raid, please - first of all, communicate front desk to immediately inform local Compliance and Legal, - stay calm, polite and cooperate with the authority, - do not obstruct the inspection and do not conceal, alter, remove or destroy any documents or electronic data and - do not conduct informal conversations. Be factual. The security or reception staff where the public officials request entrance must immediately inform the assigned representative(s) of the local Legal and Compliance team (local Legal and Compliance). Their telephone contact details must be published appropriately, for example in the local dawn raid guidance. If available and appropriate, a central dawn raid hotline or information system can be set up to direct the information to the assigned team members. In addition, Siemens AG Compliance Investigation and Regulatory Central Function (LC CO IR CF) must be informed immediately. In the event of an antitrust raid, Siemens AG Legal Competition (LC M&A CMP) must also be informed. The public official in charge of the dawn raid (lead official) must be informed that it is Siemens' general policy to cooperate with public authorities and that the notification of Legal and Compliance is intended to facilitate such cooperation. A communication ban occurs when the lead official forbids all communication for a brief period of time in order to prevent the loss of evidence, in particular when conducting simultaneous searches at multiple locations. In this case, the lead official must be asked for permission to contact (1) a representative of local Legal and Compliance or, if this request is denied, (2) an external lawyer representing the company. The lead official must be asked to identify himself/herself and his/her colleagues in order to ensure that only authorized public officials are involved in the dawn raid. The authority's address, the name of at least the lead official and, if provided, their telephone contact details must be copied or written down and be forwarded to local Legal and Compliance. The lead official must be asked to produce the search warrant. This document must then be sent by fax or e-mail to local Legal and Compliance and to Compliance Investigation and Regulatory Central Function. If the public officials do not provide a search warrant or other type of court order, they should be asked (1) which authority is conducting the investigation, and (2) what the subject of the search is, in particular, what allegations are being made. It is important to note whether the search warrant contains restrictions as to the places to be searched, specific documents or items to be seized, limitations on the dates of the documents or the timing of the dawn raid, or other restrictions. Local Legal and Compliance should then be consulted to clarify whether or not entry should be denied. In all cases, employees must refrain from physically obstructing the public officials. The lead official must be asked to wait until the arrival of the lawyer from or sent by local Legal and Compliance before commencing the search and seizure. Employees should not obstruct the search if the lead official declines to wait.

To the extent possible and permissible, a Siemens representative should be made available to the public officials as an exclusive contact person, preferably from senior management. Furthermore, to the extent possible and permissible, the public officials should be accompanied throughout their search by a sufficient number of representatives from local Legal and Compliance and/or external lawyers. The affected employees on site must be informed that Siemens is in the process of cooperating with a search by an authority. Any instructions given by the lead official or by Legal and Compliance must be given immediate attention. Employees must cooperate and may not obstruct the public officials. It is forbidden to conceal, alter, remove, or destroy any documents or electronic data in the affected areas. Employees must not inform anyone not affected by the dawn raid. If the dawn raid encompasses electronic data, the relevant IT department must be called in for support. Local Legal and Compliance must prepare a concept with the relevant IT department detailing how to retrieve electronic data and equipment and which stakeholders to involve. Local Legal and Compliance must verify the exact extent of the authorities' search and seizure powers. Some authorities may have the power to require blocking of e-mail accounts, to connect their search tools to the IT infrastructure, and to be accorded the rights of an administrator (for example under EU antitrust law). Some public officials may only have the power to seize the equipment while the review of the electronic data must be conducted by other public officials. Any Siemens employee who is asked questions by the public officials shall indicate that he or she wishes to speak to a lawyer before answering them. This applies whether the employee is questioned as a witness or as the subject of the investigation. Local Legal and Compliance shall arrange for external lawyers to represent employees during interviews if the employee is questioned as a subject. To the extent permissible, conversations with the public officials must be limited to organizational matters (such as the location of individual documents). Employees may be obliged to answer questions that refer to the topic of the search as set out in the search warrant (for example in the case of a search under EU antitrust law). Answers must be factual, correct and never speculative To the extent permitted by the public officials, copies must be made of the documents seized. In addition, all documents (whether in electronic or hardcopy form) and other items seized must be registered in an internal itemized list. 1. When public officials are inspecting or copying documents and electronic data, especially e-mails, they must be monitored and asked the following question: Does the electronic data/document/item being searched and/or seized meet the authorized scope of the search as described in the search warrant? If in doubt, employees must ask the public officials to allow local Legal and Compliance to check each copy or electronic file with them. 1. On conclusion of the search and seizure, the public officials must be asked for their written inventory, including a receipt, itemizing all documents and items seized (by name/description and location prior to seizure). Moreover, the public officials shall be asked for a copy of the list of items the public officials were ordered to seize (seizure list), if available and permitted. If so provided for under local law, steps must be taken to ensure that only items on that seizure list are seized. Any items taken by the public officials but not mentioned on the seizure list might be considered to have been surrendered voluntarily, which could have negative implications for a subsequent legal defense. Local Legal and Compliance and Siemens AG Compliance Investigation and Regulatory Central Function must be consulted before documents are handed over to determine whether Siemens has an obligation to hand them over and whether Siemens should insist on the formal seizure of the documents or produce them voluntarily. If appropriate under applicable law, steps must be taken to ensure that all items seized are listed in the authority's inventory as having been seized and not, for example, as having been surrendered voluntarily. Prior to the voluntary submission of documents, the Siemens AG Clearing Committee must be involved via Compliance Investigation and Regulatory Central Function (for details please refer to chapter Clearing Committee Guidance). If there are any differences of opinion during the search and seizure, the lead official must be asked to identify the legal basis of the action. The response must be recorded in writing.

Both cases require the Reliability Declaration for the legal entity Siemens AG (EN/DE) to be handed over to prospective customers of the legal entity Siemens AG. The Greek case also leads to the necessity for the legal entity Siemens AG to admit to an infringement of Antitrust provisions in a Single European Procurement Document (ESPD) or similar declarations.

There might be a requirement to accept the contractual partner's code of conduct or required clauses in a contract. When agreeing to a customer code or contract requirements, these will form part of the legal relationship between the parties. Failure to adhere to the requirements may result in contractual breaches and consequences with respect to such breaches.
