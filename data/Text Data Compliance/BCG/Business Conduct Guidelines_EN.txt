Munich, February 2021

Dear Colleagues,

Our position as a leading technology company comes with 
great responsibility that extends far beyond our own 
business interests. We aim to use innovative technologies 
to transform the everyday for billions of people, to foster 
prosperity and shape economic growth in a way that’s 
sustainable and uses fewer natural resources. To achieve 
these goals, we’ll need excellent technological solutions. 
But we’ll also need society’s trust and acceptance. And 
we’ll only deserve and preserve this public approval if we 
uphold the highest standards in our day-to-day conduct. 

Integrity isn’t optional. It’s the non-negotiable basis for the 
actions of every individual employee and every Siemens 
business unit as well as our partners and customers. Our 
businesses focus on generating added value and providing 
solutions for our customers. In the long-term, we can only 
succeed if the benefits that we generate are supported by 
the solid foundation of our values and our integrity. To 
ensure that we have this foundation, the Business Conduct 
Guidelines are more than just a collection of guidelines 
and a reference work. They also set out rules that are 
binding for all employees, including supervisors and 
management. Our Compliance department is available to 
provide competent support as you address the relevant 
issues. Please don’t hesitate to contact the Compliance 
team if you have any questions or are unsure about any 
internal rules or legal requirements.

We’ve started a new chapter at Siemens. Our Vision 2020+ 
strategy has given us greater entrepreneurial freedom and 
the flexibility that we need to not just respond to 
disruptive changes, but to proactively shape 
transformation ourselves. In addition, digitalization is 
changing our day-to-day work and the way that we 
collaborate with customers, partners and colleagues. It 
also enables new business models. During the pandemic, 
we’ve all experienced directly or indirectly how robust this 
new way of working with these stakeholders in digital 
ecosystems already is. To be successful in today’s world, 
we need to adopt a new, forward-looking and open-
minded attitude that we like to refer to as a “growth 
mindset” – a mentality that is characterized by staying 
curious, being resilient, experimenting and adapting. This 
approach offers opportunities and potential, but also 
involves responsibility and risks.

In times of transformation, our company’s shared values 
and integrity form the foundation for our future success. 
Keeping this in mind, please give the Business Conduct 
Guidelines the careful attention they deserve – and please 
put them into practice.


Warmest regards,

Roland Busch

President and Chief Executive Officer of Siemens AG

highest level of integrity.”

Munich, December 2018

Dear Colleagues,

Siemens stands for clean business, all over the world – this 
is our uncompromising stance. We expect it of ourselves, 
our employees, our managers, and our Managing Board 
members; and from our customers, partners, and all other 
company stakeholders.

Our company has learned lessons from its past, above all 
from the 2006 compliance crisis that brought the company 
to the brink of the abyss. Since then, we have done 
everything within our power to right the wrongs committed 
and to set Siemens on a new footing. Today, Siemens 
is in a much stronger position than it was more than a 
decade ago. We have all of you to thank for that. 
Our reputation has been restored and we are seen as a 
reliable partner – in all parts of the world. Let us continue 
to work together to ensure that it stays that way in the 
future.

The Business Conduct Guidelines represent our frame of 
reference in this endeavor. All employees, managers, and 
Managing Board members must know and understand the 
content of the Business Conduct Guidelines and apply 
them as they go about their daily business.

Please do not hesitate to contact your colleagues in the 
Legal and Compliance department at any time if you have 
questions regarding the application or interpretation of the 
Business Conduct Guidelines or if you suspect that the 
Business Conduct Guidelines have been breached. 
In addition, you can of course report any information 
regarding potential misconduct to our Tell Us Hotline, or 
our Ombudsman. Whichever option you choose, you can 
rest assured that your report will be followed up 
professionally, promptly, and fairly.

We’re counting on you!

Martina Maier & Dr. Andreas C. Hoffmann

Head of Legal and Compliance of Siemens AG

competition in our markets 
and fights corruption beyond 
company borders.”

We make real 
what matters

Our motivation and common values

Our passion for technology drives us 
to set standards and create added value 
in the long-term for our customers, 
society, and every individual.


We make real 
what matters

Through our expertise in 
electrification, automation, and 
digitization, we improve people’s 
lives today and create lasting value 
for future generations.

Our company founder, 
Werner von Siemens, would 
have called this “inventiveness.”

Today, we call it:

Ingenuity for Life



Our success is based on a strong 
corporate culture. That is why we 
drive an Ownership Culture that 
consists of five components:

Values, Behavior, 
Leadership, People 
Orientation, and Equity.

Our guiding 
principle is:

Always act as if 
it were your 
own company.

The Business Conduct Guidelines 
provide us with orientation.

They set forth our behavioral
expectations and obligations.

The Business Conduct Guidelines help us apply our values: 
innovative, excellent, and responsible.

• We are innovative to create sustainable value.
• We are excellent and achieve outstanding results.
• We act responsibly.


This is how we jointly make real what matters.



Our basic principles

Our basic principles guide our decisions and 
overall conduct as employees of Siemens

We behave correctly


We respect each other


We create trust


We protect our company


As managers, we have a 
special responsibility



We behave correctly

We comply with the applicable laws of the countries in 
which we operate and ensure the implementation of all 
company guidelines, processes, and controls.

What laws must we obey?

We must be aware of and comply with the laws and 
regulations that apply to our daily work. These laws and 
regulations may vary from country to country. If we are 
uncertain or have questions, we contact Legal and 
Compliance.

What are the consequences of violations for our 
company and for us as employees?

Violations of the law or failure to comply with the Business 
Conduct Guidelines can have serious consequences for our 
company and us.


These consequences can be,

for each of us:

• disciplinary action
• fines and damages
• imprisonment


for our company:

• damage to Siemens’ reputation, brand, and market value
• significant fines and damages
• disgorgement of profit
• exclusion from public and private contracts


We ask ourselves the following questions when making 
decisions for Siemens:

• Is it right for Siemens? Is it in line with Siemens’ 
values and our values?
• Is it legal?
• Could it affect our brand if our decision becomes 
the subject of media coverage?
• What would the people we care about think of 
our decision?
• Are we prepared to take responsibility for our decision?




We respect each other

We respect the personal dignity, privacy, and rights of each 
individual. We believe diversity enriches our workplace. We 
work together without regard to ethnic origin, culture, 
religion, age, disability, skin color, gender, sexual identity 
and orientation, or worldview.

We do not tolerate discrimination, sexual or any other form 
of harassment, or inappropriate behavior toward 
individuals or groups.

We apply these principles of respect to each other and 
third-parties with whom we interact, including our 
suppliers, customers, and business partners.


What does this mean in practice? What behavior 
is unacceptable? Here are a few examples:

• Racially offensive or xenophobic material is placed 
on a colleague’s desk;
• Innuendo or comments hostile to the disabled;
• Gender-specific harassment or violence, including 
assaults, unwanted advances, or improper remarks 
or jokes; or
• Displaying improper images or objects, including those 
with sexual content.


We create trust

We are open and honest. We take our responsibility 
seriously, we are reliable, and we only make promises we 
can keep.

We are sincere. We help clarify and eliminate potential 
deficiencies, problems, and misunderstandings. We do 
everything to fulfill the trust placed in us by our customers 
and the users of our products, services, and industry
solutions.


What do we do when we make a mistake?

We all make mistakes at work. We foster a culture where 
we learn from our mistakes. We deal openly with them to 
prevent them from recurring. This is the only way to learn 
from mistakes and help prevent them from recurring. 
While most mistakes are minor, others could have serious 
consequences and should be reported.



What do we do if we observe a violation of the 
Business Conduct Guidelines?

We do not look away when we recognize possible 
violations of the Business Conduct Guidelines, even if they 
do not involve us personally. The company has numerous 
outlets to report possible violations of the Business 
Conduct Guidelines (see chapter “Our reporting procedures”). 
In many cases, timely reporting is important to avoid or 
minimize negative consequences to the company.

We interact with each other 
in a respectful and reliable 
manner.

We protect our company

We protect and promote Siemens’ reputation and values. 
They are essential for our business success and ensure the 
sustainable future of our company. If we act illegally or 
inappropriately, we can cause considerable damage to the 
company.



Our managers lead by example 
and set the appropriate tone 
from the top.

As managers, we have a 
special responsibility

As managers, we bear a special responsibility and we take 
seriously our duty of care for the employees entrusted to us.

We create a trusting working environment and are always 
available to discuss with our employees uncertainties, 
compliance with legal requirements, questions, or 
professional and personal concerns with our employees.

We set a good example and ensure our teams understand 
the importance of acting in accordance with the Business 
Conduct Guidelines.

We take every indication of possible misconduct seriously 
and report it to Legal and Compliance. We protect the 
identity of employees who report potential misconduct and 
protect them from retaliation or other negative impact.

We fulfill our organizational and supervisory duties.

What are our organizational and 
supervisory duties?

• We carefully select employees based on their personal 
and professional qualifications and suitability. The duty 
of care increases with the importance of the task the 
employee has to perform (Duty of Selection).
• We define binding tasks precisely and completely, 
especially with regard to compliance with legal 
requirements (Duty to Issue Instructions).
• We ensure that compliance with legal requirements is 
constantly monitored (Duty to Monitor).
• In our day-to-day business, we clearly communicate the 
importance of responsible business conduct, compliance 
with legal requirements, and the consequences of our 
misconduct (Duty to Communicate).



Our managers‘ special responsibilities and duties do 
not release us from our own responsibilities as 
employees. We must work together to comply with the law 
and Siemens guidelines.



Our responsibility

We make real what matters!

We look after each other and ourselves


Our markets: we act fairly and reliably


Our company: we create trust and protect 
what makes Siemens valuable


Our portfolio: world-class products, services, 
and industry solutions


Our partners: we work with responsible partners 
Our responsibility to society and the environment



We look after each other and ourselves

Siemens protects our fundamental rights as employees, 
our health, our personal security, and occupational safety 
at all locations throughout the world and when we are on 
business travel.


Basic working conditions

Siemens fosters fair cooperation among management, 
employees, and employee representatives, 
and protects the fundamental rights of its employees.


No discrimination or intimidation

The principles of equal opportunity and equal treatment 
are guaranteed without regard to skin color, ethnic or 
social origin, religion, age, disability, sexual identity, 
worldview, or gender. In accordance with the labor laws of 
the countries in which Siemens operates, discrimination 
based on these characteristics, sexual harassment, or other 
inappropriate behavior toward individuals or groups will 
not be tolerated.


Free choice of employment

No one should be employed or forced to work against their 
will. All forms of forced labor are prohibited.


Prohibition of child labor

Child labor is strictly prohibited.


Adequate compensation

Siemens pays fair wages for labor and adheres to all 
applicable wage and compensation laws globally. Siemens 
observes “equal pay” principles and does not discriminate 
on the basis of gender.

Working hours

Siemens adheres to all applicable working-hours 
regulations globally.


Freedom of association and collective bargaining

Siemens recognizes the legal rights of workers to form or 
join existing trade unions and to engage in collective 
bargaining. Members of employee organizations or trade 
unions are neither disadvantaged nor preferred. Siemens 
constructively cooperates with employees, employee 
representatives, and trade unions.

Even in the event of disputes, Siemens strives to ensure 
sustainable and constructive cooperation in the long term 
and for solutions that reflect the interests of the company 
and the interests of its employees.



Health, occupational safety, 
and personal security

Siemens cares about us as part of its corporate 
responsibility.


Our health

Siemens protects and promotes our health and well-being, 
guards against the risk of work-related accidents, and 
offers a wide-range of support to maintain and promote 
our physical and mental health.


Our occupational safety

Siemens provides a safe work environment to ensure 
employees return home healthy and unharmed at the end 
of the working day. We ourselves contribute to this:

This is what we do:

• We observe the safety regulations at our 
workplace.
• We avoid risky behavior.
• When we recognize dangerous situations, we take 
appropriate action.


We set a good example.

Our personal security

Siemens is active worldwide, including in areas and 
situations where the security situation is critical. To protect 
our employees, the company, and our business in the best 
possible way, Siemens identifies and analyzes global 
security risks and assesses their potential impact.

This is what we do:

• We educate ourselves in advance about the 
security risks in the countries to which we will be 
traveling and comply with prescribed security 
procedures and requirements.
• We do not expose ourselves or our colleagues to 
unnecessary hazards through reckless behavior or 
by ignoring security regulations.
• We react quickly in a critical situation, contact the 
emergency hotline at +49 (89) 636 – 12345 
(staffed 24 hours a day), and follow the relevant 
security instructions.
• We report security incidents promptly to our 
security officer and/or use the security incident 
reporting tool “IncidentReporting@Siemens”(IR@S).


Our employees are our most 
valuable asset. Your health and 
safety are our top priority.



Fair competition is in line with our values: excellent, 
innovative, and responsible. Siemens stands for fair 
competition in which only market economy criteria 
(quality, price, innovation, service, etc.) are the decisive 
factors for business decisions. Competition should not 
be distorted by unfair methods or means.

Our markets: we act fairly and reliably

Fair competition: we place integrity at the 
heart of everything we do


We reject all forms of corruption and bribery.

We do not tolerate any form of corruption in our business 
dealings anywhere in the world. This includes our business 
dealings through our external partners.

Corruption

Corruption is dishonest or illegal behavior, especially by 
people in power, typically involving bribery. It can also 
include other acts, such as fraud, embezzlement, 
favoritism, and nepotism.

This is what we do:

• We do not actively or passively engage in any 
form of corrupt conduct.
• We report all suspected corrupt activity to our 
Legal and Compliance organization.


The most common form of corruption is bribery. Siemens 
does not tolerate any form of bribery.

Bribery is the act of offering, promising, or giving 
money, gifts, or other benefit to a public official or 
public or private employee with the aim of receiving 
improper advantages. Bribery is a criminal offense 
worldwide.


The term “public official” or “member of the public 
sector” covers any person employed by or 
commissioned by a public authority. This includes all 
government officials and employees of non-governmental 
institutions who are regarded as public officials in 
accordance with applicable law.



We do not tolerate any 
form of bribery.

This is what we do:

We do not:

• give or accept excessive gifts or entertainment;
• give or accept excessive travel expenses;
• give or accept inappropriate donations, 
sponsorship, or memberships;
• give or accept inappropriate monetary payments;
• use third-parties to bribe on Siemens’ behalf; or
• give or accept improper facilitation payments.


What are facilitation payments?

A facilitation payment is the payment of a relatively small 
amount of money, or the granting of any other benefit, 
usually to low-ranking public officials, for their personal 
benefit or to expedite the performance of a routine 
governmental action.

Facilitation payments are prohibited and can be prosecuted.

Gifts and hospitality – yes, but only 
to a reasonable extent

In many cultures, gifts and invitations to entertainment 
events are important for developing and deepening 
business relationships. However, some gifts and invitations 
may unreasonably influence the recipient’s decision-making 
or create the appearance of improper influence.

This is what we do:

• We do not provide overly generous gifts or 
hospitality.
• We do not provide gifts or hospitality in exchange 
for business or other benefits.


Gifts and hospitality must:

• be in accordance with applicable laws and regulations;



Regulations

Our business counterparts, especially government officials, 
often have their own internal rules that restrict their ability 
to accept gifts and hospitality. These rules can be very 
strict and we must be aware of and adhere to them:


• be transparent and correctly recorded in the company’s 
books and records;
• be appropriate in terms of type, value, and frequency to 
the occasion and the position of the recipient;
• not be offered, provided, demanded, or accepted with 
the expectation of any type of advantage; and
• never give the appearance of dishonesty or 
inappropriateness.




Sponsorships, donations, charitable contributions, and 
memberships – yes, but only to promote corporate goals

Sponsorships, donations, charitable contributions, and 
memberships are important to our social commitment and 
the pursuit of our corporate goals.

This is what we do:

Sponsorships, donations, charitable contributions, 
and memberships:

• must be carefully examined to determine whether 
they promote the company’s legitimate objectives;
• may not be promised, offered, or made to obtain 
improper business advantages or for other 
unethical purposes;
• must be religiously and politically neutral; and
• must strengthen our brand and our social 
commitments. It is not enough to consider legal 
requirements alone.


Political engagement

Continuous dialog with political decision-makers is highly 
relevant for the success of a global company. We are 
committed to political neutrality. Siemens activities with 
respect to politicians, parties, and positions will be non-
partisan; and solely in support of Siemens business goals. 
We comply with the law and Siemens guidelines.

Payment of travel expenses – 
yes, but only when reasonable and allowable

Siemens may be required to pay third-party travel expenses 
in certain business transactions. However, excessive 
reimbursement can inappropriately influence the recipient 
or at least create the appearance of influence.

This is what we do:

• We only pay justified and appropriate 
travel expenses.
• We adhere to the aforementioned regulations 
for gifts and hospitality.




Outgoing payments – yes, but only if used lawfully

Payments to third-parties are made every day in the course 
of business at Siemens. Processes and tools help us ensure 
these payments are properly documented and provided for 
proper purposes.

This is what we do:

• We only maintain accounts or funds for 
legitimate purposes.
• We only make payments to third-parties that 
are legal and have legitimate purposes.
• We only make payments when there is proper 
documentation.


Involvement of third-parties – yes, but without bribery

There are many legitimate reasons for involving third-
parties in business relationships. However, using third-
parties to unlawfully or improperly influence public 
officials or private individuals is prohibited. We therefore 
scrutinize business partners at the beginning of our 
business relationships and monitor the relationships as 
they develop.

This is what we do:

• We scrutinize and monitor business partners and 
take into account their respective risks.
• We are committed to ensuring that our partners 
in our value chain know and adhere to our values 
and compliance standards.
• We insist on contract provisions that require our 
business partners to act in compliance with all 
applicable rules and regulations.


Here are some red flags we must critically 
question and clarify:


• Inconsistencies in records and payments;
• High prices with deep discounts or unduly high 
profit margins;
• Contractual partners with unclear responsibilities 
or questionable qualifications;
• Suspicious personal relationships or business 
arrangements;
• Unusually high fees, commissions, gifts, entertainment, 
or hospitality;
• The rejection of anti-corruption contract clauses;
• The demand for prepayment without plausible 
business reasons; and
• Demands for cash payments or transfers to offshore 
bank accounts or third-parties.




“I will not sell the future 
for instant profit.”

– Werner von Siemens

We are successful in fair competition: antitrust 
law and fair competition


Antitrust law protects free, undistorted, and effective 
competition for the benefit of customers, companies, and 
society as a whole.

Antitrust violations can have serious consequences for our 
company and the employees involved, such as high fines, 
exclusion from public tenders, claims for damages, 
damage to reputation, and imprisonment.

This is what we do:

• We never enter into anticompetitive agreements 
with competitors.


What are anticompetitive agreements?

Anticompetitive agreements include price agreements, 
market, customer, or territory allocations, and project 
agreements with competitors. Abusing a dominant 
position (indicator: more than 30 to 50 percent market 
share) is also prohibited.

This is what we do:

• We only talk to competitors if we have a 
compelling business reason and there are no 
antitrust concerns.


We never talk to competitors about:


• Prices, price components, or other conditions;
• Market, customer, or territory allocation;
• Business opportunities or incoming orders;
• Capacities, production volumes, or quotas;
• Corporate strategies or future market behavior; for 
example, sales strategies, current and future product 
developments, investments, and boycotts;
• Offers and tenders; and
• Conduct during tenders or the submission of 
bogus offers.


This is what we do:

• We also support open competition in our 
relationships with customers, sales partners, 
and suppliers.
• We never talk to customers, sales partners, 
or suppliers about:
– Adherence to resale prices. In many cases, 
however, non-binding recommendations, 
without pressure or incentives, regarding resale 
prices and the establishment of maximum sale 
prices are permissible; or
– Obstruction of exports or re-imports.



• We handle confidential information from Siemens 
and third-parties, such as competitors, customers, 
sales partners, and suppliers, with care.




What is confidential information that 
deserves special protection?

Confidential information is information that is not 
intended to be made public. This may include non-public 
information from or about Siemens, suppliers, customers, 
employees, agents, consultants, or other third-parties that 
is protected under legal and contractual requirements.

This can include, for example:

• details of a company’s organization and facilities, 
prices, sales, profits, markets, customers, and other 
business matters;
• offer documents;
• information on manufacturing, research, and 
development processes;
• technical information; and
• internal reporting figures.


A few examples of what we do not do:

• We never obtain confidential information from third- 
parties without justification and use it in an unlawful 
manner, such as, for example, in the bidding process.
• We do not use confidential documents from previous 
employers or store them on Siemens networks.


This is what we do:

• For products where Siemens may have a dominant 
position (indicator: greater than 30 to 50 percent 
market share), we contact Legal and Compliance 
when confronted with the following types of 
conduct:
– exclusivity agreements or loyalty discounts;
– excessively high or low “competitive prices”;
– coupled sale of a “strong market” product 
with other products;
– unequal treatment of business partners (except 
where there is an objective justification, such as, 
for example, different sales prices due to a 
volume discount); or
– refusal of delivery or license (without an 
objective justification).



• We have potentially anticompetitive business 
partnerships examined in advance by Legal and 
Compliance, such as:
– working/bidding partnerships, consortia;
– joint research and development;
– specialization/joint production;







– standardization and harmonization;
– joint purchasing;
– exclusive distribution/exclusive procurement;
– market information systems/benchmarking; and
– Exclusivity agreements and exclusive territory 
allocation in distribution and licensing 
agreements.



• We only participate in association meetings if 
there is a written invitation with an agenda, 
representatives of the association are present, 
and minutes are kept. Further information can 
be found in the “Recommendations for action in 
working with associations.”


We comply with trade and export control 
regulations

As a company with international operations, it is essential 
for Siemens to comply with the export control and customs 
regulations applicable to national and international trade.

This is what we do:

• We carefully ensure that the applicable customs 
and foreign trade regulations, including 
regulations on security in the supply chain, are 
checked, implemented, and complied with when 
goods are traded or transported, services are 
provided, or other technical know-how or software 
is transferred.
• We thoroughly audit business in sanctioned 
countries.
• We ensure that all applicable export control 
regulations (such as those of the European Union 
and the United States) are checked and complied 
with in Siemens’ business activities, even outside 
the respective territories.
• We distance ourselves from a transaction and alert 
Export Control when there are indications of 
possible infringements or unauthorized use of our 
products, services, or industry solutions.


Collective Action: our commitment to clean 
markets pays off

Siemens faces significant compliance risks in numerous 
markets. Collective Action is our strategic response to this 
challenge. Together with other companies, the public 
sector, and civil society, we enter into integrity and 
compliance pacts with our partners for business 
cooperation and support binding agreements for individual 
sectors and markets.

Through these joint efforts, we aim to create fair, level, 
and clean market conditions for all participants.



The Siemens brand is a promise of innovation and quality. It 
must be relevant, tangible, and capable of being experienced. 
And it has to open doors all over the world. That is the 
case today. And it should remain that way in the future.

Our company: we create trust and protect 
what makes Siemens valuable

The Siemens brand: a promise of innovation 
and quality


The Siemens brand is an integral part of our business and, 
therefore, has significant strategic importance. It is one of 
our major corporate assets and competencies, generates 
trust, and has a positive effect on all our business activities. 
With the Siemens brand, we distinguish ourselves from 
the competition.

This is what we do:

• We are innovative and constantly working on new 
business ideas. However, we always make 
decisions to protect or strengthen the Siemens 
brand, not in favor of a particular business alone.
• When in doubt and before making a decision 
regarding the Siemens brand, we contact the 
Brand Design Hotline 
(design-support.communications@siemens.com).


In addition to the Siemens brand, intellectual property 
rights, patents, copyrights, and confidential know-how, 
and their protection, are essential for our business success. 

This is what we do:

• We, as inventors, support Siemens by filing for 
intellectual property rights in a timely manner.
• We report suspected violations of our intellectual 
property rights.
• We use computer software only in accordance with 
applicable license terms and ensure compliance 
with all license requirements of integrated third- 
party software, commercial, and open source 
software, in our products and solutions.
• We respect the intellectual property rights of third- 
parties.




Handling of the Siemens brand and other 
intellectual property rights


What makes the Siemens brand so valuable?

The brand...

• provides focus to our stakeholders, such as 
customers, employees, etc.;
• distinguishes us from the competition; and
• ultimately generates trust.


Why are intellectual property rights so 
important to Siemens?

If our innovations are not protected, third-parties can copy 
our products, which leads to a loss of competitive 
advantage. When our innovations are infringed, we lose 
the value of our investments in research and development.

Conflicts of interest – we only make business 
decisions in the interest of Siemens


We are not influenced by personal interests when making 
business decisions. Such conflicts of interest can hinder 
Siemens’ success in that decisions are made contrary to 
Siemens' interest, customers are driven away, or important 
information is disclosed.


Conflicts of interest may, for example:

• harm Siemens if contracts are awarded on the basis of 
personal relationships that contain inferior terms from 
those of competitors; and
• lead to reputational damage if they are made public; 
dissatisfied employees or former customers could 
communicate conflicts to the outside world.


There is a conflict of interest in day-to-day business if 
our personal interests differ from those of Siemens.

This is what we do:

• We make business decisions in the best interest of 
our company and not on the basis of personal 
interests.
• We anticipate and avoid situations in which the 
appearance of a conflict of interest may arise.
• We do not, as part of our work for Siemens, engage 
companies with which we have a personal interest 
if it could personally benefit us, whether or not we 
have or can exert direct or indirect influence on 
Siemens’ business decision.
• We inform our managers of any personal interest 
that might exist in connection with the 
performance of our official duties.


To protect ourselves and our company, we pay 
close attention to possible conflicts of interest. 
The following questions help us assess whether there is 
a conflict or an appearance of a conflict:

• Is the decision we make for Siemens influenced by 
personal interests?
• What impression would the situation leave on third- 
parties, such as customers, business partners, and 
investors?
• How would the public react to my business decision?



Here is a classic example of an internal conflict of 
interest:

There is an intimate relationship between an employee and 
a manager. The manager is obliged to disclose the conflict 
of interest at an early stage and change the reporting 
relationship.



Competition with Siemens

A conflict of interest may also arise in business relationships 
with or through investments in a competitor or customer of 
Siemens.

This is what we do:

• We do not operate or work for a company that 
competes with Siemens.
• We do not engage in any activity that competes 
with Siemens.



Typical examples of a competitive situation:

• The employee also works for or advises a 
competitor of Siemens.
• The employee himself competes directly with 
Siemens.
• There are personal or family ties to competitors.


Secondary employment

A conflict may also arise in the performance of secondary 
employments that prevent us from properly performing our 
duties at Siemens.

This is what we do:

• Before we engage in paid secondary employment, 
we consult with our managers. We inform the 
Human Resources department in writing that we 
would like to take up paid secondary employment 
and will only do so after obtaining written consent. 


Secondary employment can only be prohibited, and 
previously granted permission can be revoked, if it 
leads to an impairment of the employee’s work 
performance, interferes with his or her duties within the 
company, or if there is a risk of a conflict of interest. 
Occasional writing, lecturing, and similar activities, and 
temporary seasonal or clerical work are not regarded as 
secondary employment.


Investment in third-party companies

Conflicts of interest can also arise through investments 
in third-party companies.

This is what we do:

We inform the Human Resources department in 
writing of any direct or indirect investment in 
companies:

• that are business partners of Siemens if we are 
engaged in business with the company or have a 
board or management role in the company. With 
respect to publicly traded companies, this only 
applies if the investment exceeds three percent of 
the total capital; or
• that compete with our company if we can 
influence the management of the competitor 
through this investment. This is presumed if the 
interest exceeds three percent of the total capital 
of the company.




Money laundering and the funding of terrorism – 
not with us!

Delivery and supply activities entail the risk of being 
abused for money laundering or terrorist financing.

Siemens strives to maintain business relationships only 
with reputable customers, partners, and companies whose 
business activities comply with legal requirements and 
whose financial resources are of legitimate origin.


Money laundering is the disguising of the origin of 
money or other assets from criminal activities and 
moving them into the legitimate economy. In addition to 
monetary support, the funding of terrorism may include 
other assets such as goods or merchandise.

This is what we do:

• We use a risk-based approach to verify the identity 
and economic background of customers, business 
partners, and other third-parties, and the origin of 
payments to ensure they come from legitimate 
sources.
• We immediately inform Legal and Compliance or 
our manager in the event of suspicious activity. 
When necessary, Siemens reports suspicious 
activity to law enforcement authorities.




Financial integrity – this is how we strengthen 
the trust placed in us

As an international company, Siemens is committed to 
accurate and truthful reporting to investors, employees, 
customers, business partners, the public, and all 
government agencies. We follow all applicable laws, 
regulations, standards, and practices.

This is what we do:

• We ensure our books and records are kept 
completely, accurately, and truthfully. They are 
prepared on time and in accordance with the 
applicable rules and standards.
• We comply with the Financial Reporting Guidelines 
and follow internal control processes.
• We provide correct and complete information for 
financial reporting purposes.


Our accounts and records include all data, certificates, 
and other written materials provided for financial 
reporting and disclosure purposes, and materials collected 
for other purposes.

This is what we do:

• When applying tax laws, or in the event of conflicts 
between tax regulations, we ensure the tax result 
is consistent with the relevant economic and legal 
circumstances and our business models.
• We do not use artificial structures or letterbox 
companies whose sole purpose is to obtain 
unlawful tax advantages.
• We provide tax authorities with transparent 
information on our tax strategy and business 
activities in accordance with existing regulations.


Am I responsible for tax matters even if I do not 
work directly in the Finance or Tax Department?

Yes. We are all responsible for tax matters in the context of 
our business activities. The correct fiscal representation of a 
business activity is not only the responsibility of the Finance 
or Tax Department. All transactions must be reflected 
correctly for tax purposes. For example, a customer invoice 
must contain, among other things, accurate information 
about the content of the service provided and the correct VAT.


I am planning a business transaction with a 
customer abroad. What do I have to do from a tax 
perspective?

If you are unsure about the tax consequences of the 
transaction, contact the Tax Department for advice.



Insider trading – neither for us, 
nor for others!

Insider information may not be used or disclosed without 
authorization.


What is insider information?

In our work, we often come into contact with confidential 
information. If it becomes known, some of this information 
may even be important enough to have a material effect on 
the share price of Siemens or another company, such as, for 
example, one of our publicly traded customers or suppliers, 
one of our publicly traded subsidiaries, or a joint venture 
partner. This is called “insider information” as long as it has 
not yet been published. Insider information can also consist 
of many individual pieces of information that we have 
gained, for example, from discussions and documents 
inside and outside the company or received incidentally. 
Our individual knowledge of the situation always matters.


What is an insider and what are the consequences 
of being an insider?

An insider is someone who has inside information. This 
person is subject to strict legal requirements. In almost all 
countries in which Siemens operates, there are severe 
sanctions for the prohibited use of insider information. 
Such misuse could have considerable consequences for the 
company concerned, and result in personal and criminal 
liability.

This is what we do:

• We do not engage in transactions based on insider 
information, such as the purchase or sale of a 
share or option or the cancellation of a share 
purchase order, for us or for others.
• We do not induce others, such as friends or bank 
advisors, to engage in securities transactions on 
the basis of insider information, and we do not 
recommend such transactions to them.
• We treat insider and potential insider information 
with strict confidentiality and ensure that 
unauthorized persons cannot gain access to it.


How do we know if we are an insider?

We must consider whether information we receive can 
have a significant impact on our share price such that, if 
disclosed, it represents insider information. Ultimately, 
Siemens cannot make this decision for us. Furthermore, it 
is not the formal inclusion in an insider list that is decisive, 
but whether we are actually aware of insider information. 
Whether an insider list is opened and who is included in it 
should be viewed as a separate decision to be made by the 
company. This also applies to insider information that 
concerns another company.


Can we be sure we are not violating the ban on 
insider trading when participating in employee 
stock ownership programs?

Siemens strives to enable us to participate in employee 
stock ownership programs with the lowest possible risk of 
violating the insider trading prohibition. However, this does 
not rule out the possibility that we may have knowledge of 
insider information in individual cases. Therefore, when 
actively participating in employee stock programs, we 
should always ask ourselves whether we can make the 
purchase or sale decisions without being influenced by 
possible insider information.



How we responsibly protect our 
corporate assets

Our corporate assets are essential to our business success. 
For this reason, we ensure that these assets are handled 
responsibly and fully protected. As employees, we play a 
decisive role in achieving this goal.


We identify our critical corporate assets and implement 
protection measures to adequately protect them

In order to adequately protect our corporate assets, 
we need to know and evaluate them.

This is what we do:

• We identify critical business assets in our respective 
areas of responsibility and classify them according 
to their potential impact in the event of a security 
incident.
• We develop and implement holistic protection 
measures based on the classification of corporate 
assets.
• We ensure the sustainable protection of our 
corporate assets by regularly reviewing the 
classifications and protection measures.


We treat company information with due care

Siemens attaches great importance to ensuring that 
sensitive company information cannot fall into the hands 
of unauthorized persons or third-parties. In this way, we 
create the trust required for worldwide cooperation with 
customers and partners.



This is what we do:

• We classify information according to company 
specifications and treat it according to its 
protection class. This means we do not use 
information and documents marked “restricted”, 
“confidential”, or “strictly confidential” externally. 
This also applies to internal social media platforms, 
unless the terms of use permit otherwise.
• We only send confidential or critical business 
content in encrypted form and store it accordingly.
• We do not share personal passwords and access 
codes with third-parties.
• We do not disclose confidential information.
• We always adhere to the Basic Principles of 
Communication when dealing with company 
information. This also applies to business and 
personal use of social media.


Basic Principles of Communication

• We take the confidentiality of internal company 
information into account in all communications.
• We check non-public information for its potential status 
as insider information prior to publication.
• We adhere to the defined core messages to ensure the 
company-wide consistency and reliability of the 
messages.
• We are particularly cautious with forecasts and other 
forward-looking statements.
• We respond to rumors and speculation with 
“No comment”.
• We are careful during our private conversations.
• We do not communicate within the “quiet period”.


Examples of confidential information can be found in 
the chapter on free competition (chapter G2).

We handle company equipment and facilities 
with due care

We treat with care the company equipment and facilities 
at our disposal for our daily work.

This is what we do:

• We take responsibility that the facilities and 
materials provided to us, such as telephones, 
laptops, e-mail and intranet, internal social media 
platforms, copiers, mailrooms, and tools, are only 
used for business purposes consistent with local 
company policy.
• We are permitted to use corporate Internet access 
for private purposes – including external social 
media – consistent with local company policy.
• When we privately publish content on social media 
platforms and identify ourselves as Siemens 
employees, we make it unmistakably clear, through 
a disclaimer or otherwise, that we are expressing 
our personal opinion and that it does not 
necessarily reflect the position of our company.




• We do not retrieve or share information that 
supports or encourages racial hatred, glorification 
of violence or other crimes, or content that is 
sexually offensive to a particular culture.
• We ensure that no recordings, files, images, or 
sound reproductions are made using our 
company’s equipment, unless it directly relates to 
our professional activity and our manager 
approves.


Data protection and privacy – 
we are aware of our responsibilities

The protection of personal data plays an important role in 
our digitized world. We handle it carefully and responsibly 
and respect everyone’s privacy. The loss or improper use of 
personal data can have serious consequences for the 
individuals concerned. It is therefore very important for 
Siemens to ensure that this data is effectively protected 
and used only for legitimate purposes.

All of us who handle the personal data of employees, 
customers, or third-parties bear a high level of 
responsibility.


Personal data is information about specific or 
identifiable natural persons, such as name and 
address, photos, personnel number, bank data, digital 
identifiers, or health data.

This is what we do:

• We collect and process personal data confidentially, 
only for legitimate, predetermined purposes, and 
in a transparent manner.
• We only process personal data if it is protected 
against loss, modification, and unauthorized use or 
disclosure by appropriate technical and 
organizational measures.
• We will immediately inform our company’s local 
Data Protection Organization of possible data 
protection violations.




Our portfolio: world-class products, services, 
and industry solutions

Siemens stands for world-class quality and wants to inspire 
its customers with excellent and innovative products, 
services, and industry solutions.

Our top priority is the security of our portfolio for 
customers and all those who come into contact with it, 
and its legal conformity, quality, and environmental 
compatibility. Products and services sold by Siemens do 
not pose unacceptable risks to life, health, or property. 
Compliance with applicable technical regulations for 
approval and marketing in our market countries is a 
fundamental requirement for the design and distribution 
of our products and services. We keep our technical 
promises (technical compliance).

In a world of “smart products” and ever-increasing 
digitalization, our aim is to fulfill the trust placed in 
Siemens and in us.

This is what we do:

• In our areas of responsibility, we ensure that our 
products, services, and industry solutions are safe 
and comply with applicable legal requirements in 
our market countries for their safety, approval, 
marketing, and use.
• We keep our technical promises.
• If we become aware of any quality, safety, or other 
conformity defects in our area of responsibility, or 
if there are any indications of such defects, we will 
follow-up and report them.
• We observe the ten principles of cybersecurity in 
everything we do.


Where can violations occur in the area of technical 
compliance?

• Active deception: Making declarations that contain 
false product information.
• Deception by omission: Omitting information about 
product defects at any point in their development, 
marketing, or use.


The ten principles for cyber security 
(Charter of Trust) are:

01 Responsibility for cyber and IT security

02 Responsibility for the digital supply chain 

03 Cyber security as the plant standard 

04 Focusing on the needs of users

05 Innovation and co-creation

06 Making cyber security an integral part of training

07 Certification of critical infrastructures and IoT solutions

08 Increasing transparency and responsiveness

09 Regulatory framework

10 Promoting joint initiatives

Our partners: 
we work with responsible partners

Business relationships with our customers, suppliers, and 
other business partners are fundamental to Siemens.

We maintain business relationships only with reputable 
partners who comply with the law.

We protect the interests of our customers through the 
careful selection of suppliers and other business partners 
and through the standards we set for our own actions. 
That is why we cooperate with excellent partners 
worldwide.

This is what we do:

• We carefully select our suppliers and other 
business partners.
• We contractually oblige our suppliers and business 
partners to adhere to a uniform Code of Conduct 
for Siemens Supplier and Third-Party 
Intermediaries.
• Sustainability is a core element of our supplier 
management.


The Code of Conduct is based, among other things, 
on the UN Global Compact and the principles of the 
International Labor Organization, and it reflects the 
Siemens Business Conduct Guidelines, which apply to the 
entire company.

The following principles apply to cooperation 
with our partners:

• We work closely with our suppliers and business partners.
• We partner with our suppliers and help them improve.
• We constantly analyze our current business relationships 
and react immediately to emerging risks.
• We only work with suppliers who are prepared to 
eliminate problems or implement risk reduction measures.
• We conduct appropriate due diligence reviews, including 
compliance with export controls and anti-money 
laundering laws.
• We assess project risks when deciding whether to bid 
on a project.




Our responsibility to society and the environment

Siemens serves society wherever we operate. As a globally 
active company with innovative and investment capabilities, 
Siemens shares responsibility for sustainable development 
worldwide and makes a variety of contributions to it. In 
addition, Siemens is voluntarily and purposefully committed 
to promoting social concerns and needs.

Our commitment to international agreements 
and recommendations

Siemens is participant of the United Nations Global 
Compact. Its ten principles and the Global IndustriAll Union 
framework agreement are binding on the entire company.

We are committed to promoting these principles within our 
sphere of influence. Respect for human rights, 
fundamental employee rights, environmental protection, 
and the ban on corruption are an integral part of our 
business.

In line with its commitment under the Global 
Compact, Siemens expects us and our suppliers 
and business partners worldwide to comply with the 
following guidelines:

• International Bill of Human Rights, consisting of:
– Universal Declaration of Human Rights;
– International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights; and
– International Covenant on Economic, Social and 
Cultural Rights;



• European Convention on Human Rights;
• ILO (International Labour Organization) Tripartite 
Declaration of Principles on Multinational Enterprises 
and Social Policy and ILO Declaration on Fundamental 
Principles and Rights at Work, (in particular, on the 
following topics: elimination of child labor, abolition of 
forced labor, prohibition of discrimination, freedom of 
association, and the right to collective bargaining), and 
fundamental freedoms;
• OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises;
• Agenda 21 on sustainable development (final document 
of the fundamental UN Conference on Environment and 
Development, Rio de Janeiro);
• UN Convention against Corruption; and
• OECD Convention against Bribery of Foreign 
Public Officials.




Human rights

Siemens proclaims human rights are a core element of 
responsible business conduct and advocate for human 
rights in its value chain. Siemens operates in close 
alignment with the United Nations’ guiding principles for 
business and human rights.

Compliance with the human rights laws and regulations is 
essential. Siemens expects us to act in accordance with the 
principles of the Global Compact.


Key principles of the Global Compact

• Principle 1: 
Businesses support and respect the protection of 
internationally recognized human rights.
• Principle 2: 
Businesses should ensure that they are not complicit 
in human rights abuses.
• Principles 3 to 6:
Businesses recognize the essential requirements 
regarding workers’ rights.


This is what we do:

• We examine the decisions that we make on behalf 
of our company at an early stage for possible 
adverse effects on the human rights of others 
inside and outside Siemens.
• We strive to avoid or mitigate negative effects on 
human rights that occur in connection with our 
business activities, regardless of whether Siemens 
has caused or contributed to these effects.
• We respect the human rights of local communities 
and of people who are particularly vulnerable.


Which groups are particularly in need of 
protection?

These include – depending on the specific facts and legal 
circumstances – members of indigenous peoples, children, 
people with disabilities, and people who are disadvantaged 
or exposed to special risks because of their skin color, 
ethnic or social origin, religion, age, disability, sexual 
identity, worldview, or gender.



Environment

Environmental protection is a corporate responsibility, 
social responsibility, and an important success factor for 
Siemens. In all units of the company and in all countries in 
which we operate, it is our goal to protect the environment 
and conserve resources.

We work on environmental protection within the company 
and together with our customers, for example, by 
continuously improving energy and resource efficiency.

Siemens expects us to engage in environmentally 
conscious behavior every day. We should be aware of our 
exemplary roles when it comes to the environment.


What environmental programs does Siemens 
have?

The Siemens environmental programs are designed to 
conserve resources throughout the entire product life-
cycle, reduce waste for disposal, and make our own 
business activities CO2-neutral. The Siemens Environmental 
Portfolio is our and our company’s response to climate 
change, resource scarcity, and threats to the environment.

Our company meets the ecological demands of its partners 
by developing future-oriented and resource-efficient 
solutions, products, and business models. Consistent and 
innovative environmental protection management is an 
integral part of our business processes and goes beyond 
legal requirements. We exert an influence on 
environmental impacts at an early stage in product and 
production planning, not only in the manufacturing phase, 
but also in the design, sales, utilization, service, and 
disposal phases. Climate protection plays a particularly 
important role for our company.

This is what we do:

• Climate protection is closely linked to energy 
consumption. We use energy rationally and 
efficiently.
• We try to avoid or recycle waste.
• We design our processes to achieve the best 
possible environmental compatibility of products 
and plants and avoid unnecessary emissions and 
noise pollution.




Our reporting procedures

What to do if there are signs of possible misconduct?



Siemens expects us to report possible violations of the 
Business Conduct Guidelines. In so doing, we help to 
identify and eliminate misconduct and grievances and 
protect ourselves and the company against risks or 
damages that may result.


We may report circumstances that indicate a violation 
of the Business Conduct Guidelines to the following 
persons or entities:


• Managers;
• Chief Compliance Officer;
• Compliance department and Legal department;
• Human Resources personnel;
• “Tell Us” Hotline;
• Siemens ombudsman; or
• Employee representatives.


Information on possible violations of the Business Conduct 
Guidelines can be provided confidentially and 
anonymously as needed. Siemens will examine all reports 
and take appropriate measures. Siemens does not tolerate 
any retaliation against complainants or whistleblowers. 
Violations of this prohibition will be punished as 
compliance violations.

All allegations of possible violations of the Business 
Conduct Guidelines are responded to in accordance with 
formal company-wide processes. These processes take into 
account the presumption of innocence and the 
participation rights of employee representatives where 
required by local policy. Siemens will take appropriate 
disciplinary action in the event of demonstrable violations.

Siemens will apply the same principles to allegations of 
wrongdoing brought by third-parties.
